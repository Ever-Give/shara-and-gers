Men never learn

This summer has had some wet adventures… Here's one I thought I would share…

This guy I was dating at the time and I had gone swimming at a local community pool…we had been there about a hour or so and and he was sitting in a chair and I was sitting on his lap and we were talking… I really started to feel the need to piss so I told him I needed to run to the bathroom and pee. I started to get up but he would not let me up…he kept saying for me to wait a little longer but I told him I really needed to go now! I jokingly told him if he didn't let me up he might get wet to which he laughed and told me he knew I was not stupid enough to pee right there…

Well I don't like being called stupid…so I told him we would see.

I sat up and spread my legs slightly apart and asked him if he had any “Final words”…

I think he saw now that I was serious and he let go telling me I could go and use the bathroom…but I told him it was too late for that… I began to release a steady stream of pee which soaked into his shorts and ran down his legs and onto the patio…he just sat there speechless as I emptied my bladder onto his lap. When I got up I dove into the pool leaving him sitting in a puddle of urine… I can't understand why he has not called to ask me out again :-)
