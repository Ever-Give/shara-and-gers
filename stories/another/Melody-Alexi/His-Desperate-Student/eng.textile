His Desperate Student

Copyright © 2020, Melody Alexi.

Be Warned. In this erotic little story, you will find: pee desperation, desperate wetting, light anal, teacher-student dynamics... and generally steamy stuff. Welcome to my late-night fantasies. Only keep reading if you’re into that life.

Chapter 1

Nathan couldn't help but watch the lithe blonde girl jittering in her chair. Goody-two- shoes to a fault, she wore stockings under her skirt and kept crossing and uncrossing her legs suspiciously. She nervously swept her bangs out of her eyes and stared at the clock more than once.

The clock finally struck twelve, and the remaining students either groaned or sighed in relief.

Nathan was wildly relieved when he got to be a research assistant rather than a teaching assistant. But when one of his fellow grad students got sick (or had to deliver a baby or something), he'd been forced to substitute her class for a solid month if he wanted to keep his stipend. And he was going to have to make it through grad school somehow.

Students aggravated him in general with their searing entitlement, but students who found it funny or menial to cheat really set him on edge. The very first Bio exam he'd administered, he'd watched this little snoot of a bun-wearing girl peek at the exam of the equally-inept boy who sat in front of her. People who thought they could get places without working... that was what really got to him.

He'd ripped the girl a new one, calling her out in front of the class, and announcing, "Instant fail." Everyone had stared on in horror at the spectacle but the young blonde woman with the bangs, Emeline was her name— who in the 21st century named their child Emeline?— had looked particularly terrified.

Right then and there he'd installed the first of his anti-cheating policies. Henceforth and forevermore, if you were caught looking at anybody else's exam, you would be instantly ejected from the classroom and receive an automatic fail. When he got tired of students skittering 'to the bathroom', often with friends, he installed his next one. Once you left the room of an exam, you were done. Out. Finished. There would be no returning. No exceptions.

Again, the little blonde girl had looked horrified. She seemed to slip to the bathroom rather often herself, and he didn't want to punish innocents for everyone else's crime. But it was only for a month. Surely they could handle some strict oversight for just a month.

He sat stiffly at the desk as the students packed up their belongings and plopped their exams on his desk, most of them anxiously avoiding his eyes while they did so.

Emeline dropped hers and darted out quickly, only to come back a few minutes later while the last sleepy students were still packing up.

Detestable undergrads, thinking a 10-12 class was somehow an ill use of them and their time.

Emeline held back, fiddling nervously with the dorky pins that littered her backpack. Nancy Drew, a TARDIS, a well-read-women quote. He’d have found her interests cute if everything about her didn’t feel so constructed.

When the last of the students turned their test in and skittered away, she inched forward and dropped hers with a brave little smile.

"Professor. I was wondering if I could talk to you."

They all immediately assumed he was a seasoned professor— probably because he had an unfortunate, or dashing depending on who you asked, streak of prematurely grey hair. He didn't correct them when they called him by the title.

"Miss Emeline?" he said, gruffly.

"I was wondering if I could maybe talk to you."

"You can," he began to neaten the errant papers into a stack.

"I know that a week from now we have our midterm."

"Yes."

"Are you thinking it will take most of us the full four hours?"

"Judging from the pace of work so far, I doubt most you will finish in four hours."

Her cheeks flushed a little red like she wasn't used to anything other than being automatically liked.

"I was just wondering—" she again fidgeted uncomfortably, and avoided looking into his eyes like they bothered her.

"Since it's just so long... will you be lifting the bathroom ban?"

He smirked in surprise. Bathroom Ban, was that what they were calling it?

"I mean it's just I need to do well in this class to get into the Science Ed program and some of us — I — have a small kind of condition. Well. Not diagnosed. But it's hard to—" she swallowed and he perhaps enjoyed watching her white throat bob more than he should have.

Still, he didn't like the helpless little girl routine. He liked more powerful women who were submissive in bed. He guessed it felt like more of a power exchange, an achievement.

And he absolutely didn't like being manipulated.

So, he was not predisposed to be very thrilled with this interaction, her batting her eyelashes like a little lost doe.

"I will need a note from Disability Services to make any accommodations. The policy is in my revised substitute syllabus so it's staying until Jane gets back from her vacation."

"You mean childbirth."

"Yes, sure." Anything that didn't have to do with his studies didn't catch too much of his attention right now.

"Well, that's just it." The flush of embarrassed red was spreading over her cheeks. "I don't know if they'll give me a note since I don't have a diagnosis and it's uncomfortable to talk about."

"Hmm. Unfortunate," he slid the stack of exams into his computer bag, already dreading pouring over them and the various doodles and half-assed explanations.

"I..." she began again, not used to not getting her way through sweetness and helpless reasoning. She seemed to finally process how uninterested he was, as he began swiping test instructions from the whiteboard.

"Never mind," she said finally, admitting defeat, and scurried away.

Chapter 2

The midterm wasn't an hour in before Emeline began squirming.

He watched as she first oh-so-casually crossed and uncrossed her ankles, then looked at the clock.

Three hours to go, little miss helpless, he couldn't help thinking. But even as he was aggravated with her, with people who used manipulation to get through life in general, he found he couldn't keep his eyes from straying to her.

He reabsorbed himself in pouring over medical research abstracts while his students continued circling and scribbling and guessing between multiple choice answers.

Before he knew it, it was hour two. But while the hour had zipped by for him, he had a strong feeling it wasn't zipping by for anybody else, and particularly not for Emeline. Her legs were tensely entwined now, her right shoe tapping quietly but rapidly on the floor. She was careening through the answers faster than usual, circling and scribbling madly.

###

Emeline couldn't believe her luck. The one time a teacher didn't like her was the one time it was all riding on so much. This was the only class she was struggling with and if she didn't get into the Science Ed program, she'd have to wait a whole semester to reapply. And that threw a wrench in the whole timeline of her carefully-laid life plan.

There was a pulsing in her lower tummy that she tried desperately to ignore. She delicately clenched her legs together and turned all her attention to scribbling answers.

All she'd ever had to do before was flash her winning little shy smile at professors and they'd bent over backward to give her what she needed.

She couldn't help an ever-so-small glare in the substitute prof's direction— only to realize he was looking directly back at her. She buried her nose back in her test and felt an urgent swelling in her pussy. She didn't know if it was desperation or something like a flutter of excitement. She couldn't decide which would be more embarrassing.

The clock's tick seemed extraordinarily loud.

She peeked up to make sure Nathan wasn't looking at her still. He was shuffling through pages of research. Good. She seized the opportunity to look down and ever-so-slightly part her legs, just to make sure there wasn't the beginnings of a puddle in her chair. Dry. Thank heaven.

She pressed her knees back together and regretted spreading them, even for a minute.

There was no denying it anymore.

She had to pee.

And she had to pee soon. She checked the clock and was crushed to realize that only a minute had passed since last she checked.

She had practically two whole hours still to go. There was no way she was going to make it, and she wasn't even half done with the test.

Distract yourself, she chanted, and began rapid-fire circling multiple choice answers. The questions were swimming before her eyes, but she forced her way through the blur and the feeling that her face had gone very terribly hot.

She jittered achingly pressing her pencil down too hard.

And she released a helpless gasp.

She felt a small hot spurt in her panties.

It was small. She swallowed hard. It was small, even if it was warm and wet and she could feel it, just enough to make her uncomfortable. She would be okay.

She kept her knees pressed together, shaking. But she felt sure there was a dark patch on her panties. Sweat caused her bangs to cling to her forehead.

She was just going to have to ask.

But God, she dreaded standing up in front of everyone.

She shakily stood.

And sure enough, several eyes shot to her, and that was almost enough to make her pee right there.

She had to take a moment to process, to make sure she wasn't wetting right that moment. Nothing was coursing down her legs.

She forced herself to hold her head up, collect her test casually like she had a question, and approach his desk.

He didn't even lift his head, or even acknowledge her existence until he realized she wasn't leaving.

"Are you done, Miss Emeline?"

"No." He finally looked up at her and she forced her most winning shy smile. "But I was wondering if you could make an exception just this once?" She lowered her voice to a barely-there whisper. "I just have to pop into the bathroom and I'll be right back. I'll even leave my test right here with you."

He spoke too loudly blowing her stealthy cover. "Why should I make an exception for you and nobody else in the classroom? If you want to leave, leave. But you won't be coming back to finish."

At his words, she began trembling with rage and need.

But even in her helpless ache, she wasn't entirely without her usual clever faculties. Perhaps her trembling vulnerable emotion could work for her. Tears welled in her eyes and she let them. "Please," she whispered softly. "Professor. It's an emergency."

"My apologies," he said, sounding genuinely concerned. Then he looked back at his research, expression bland like usual. "Turn in your exam and you can go see to it."

She couldn't believe this.

She couldn't believe him.

How did a person get to be so heartless and cruel?

And she couldn't believe herself.

Standing there, on trembling legs, she wanted to burst into tears for the need to go. But at the same time, some small part of her found him infuriatingly appealing, immersed in his work like that, handsome, aloof, and purposefully torturing her.

Fucker.

She slunk back to her seat, limply holding her test, face burning.

People were staring at her as she went, adding to the hot slick feeling she felt on her forehead. She sank carefully into her seat.

Oh, God. She could smell herself. A faint scent emanating from her panties, beneath her skirt, like arousal and the tiniest hint of pee.

But the arousal part was undeniable.

She looked up at her professor and then looked back down again.

She'd read that erotic excitement could help distract from need to pee. And she didn't need much fodder for the imagination. It wasn't hard to imagine Nathan cornering her at the back of the class, or in his office, commanding her to lift her skirts, to take her damp panties off...

She felt a surge between her legs and nearly panicked. She couldn't decide whether to keep her legs apart, to avoid any further pressure on her bladder, or squeeze them together.

She ended up pressing her legs primly and lightly together and trying, hard, to focus.

Numbers and words swirled in front of her eyes as she worked her way down through the questions. She forced herself to concentrate on each and every single word to make them make meaning.

By immersing herself completely in the test she somehow managed to make an hour pass without noticing.

She looked at the clock. Only one hour left.

She looked at the ticking hand a little too long. It was moving so excruciatingly slow that watching it made her feel sick.

She tightened her sweaty grip fiercely around her pencil and forced herself to circle and short-answer away.

She wasn't sure if she was imagining it or if the professor kept occasionally glancing in her direction and glancing back up at the clock like this was some kind of sordid game.

She wished the helplessness of it all didn't, in some strange way, turn her on, and make her think of him more.

Chapter 3

He watched it all happen, unable to look away.

Something about a girl used to getting things her way, looking so helpless... It was so singularly arousing...

Maybe he was discovering a new fetish in real-time.

Others slowly began to finish their tests, sigh to let him know how cruel it was of him to do absurd things like test their knowledge, and turn them in.

She looked at the clock more than once before forcing herself to look back at the test. He could hardly help but smirk. The stubborn girl wasn't going to leave even a handful of segments unanswered. He had to at least admire that.

But then, maybe she was just waiting until everybody else left in case she absolutely soaked herself when she stood up. Something about that idea was tortuously hot to him.

She scribbled furiously, circled furiously, looked at the clock, looked helpless, looked back to her test.

Students continued filtering out one by one.

Emeline noticed them leaving, watched them leave as if she was jealous, but still didn't leave herself.

She was hanging back in case she really peed herself.

He imagined it: her standing after all the others left and wetting herself only and entirely for him, crying her eyes out in front of him, caving to that sweet, awful, mortifying release.

But when the last handful of students sullenly turned in their test and left, she stood up like a shot. She shoved her pencil into her bag, slung her bag over her shoulder, grabbed up her test, and hurried down to the aisle to his desk.

She dropped the test in front of him without a word and bolted out the door.

Well. That was that, then.

He cleared his throat and tried to recover from the sudden feverish fantasies of her coming undone in front of him. He collected the test papers in one fell swoop, crammed them into his bag, and left the classroom.

Emeline was scurrying down the hallway, bee-lining for the nearest bathrooms: the ones near his office.

He couldn't help but watch her, trying to walk quickly and still keep her legs together. Her bottom was plump and becoming.

God damn it, Nathan, control yourself.

Emeline was almost past his office and nearly to her destination— when two girls stopped her.

"Em!" One of the girls waved.

She stopped and spun to face them, looking deathly pale.

"Becky! Samantha!" The blonde girls looked as basic as their names, all the way down to their bedazzled Starbucks tumblers.

"We were talking about moving the student council meeting."

She would be on the student council.

He tried hard not to smirk any more than he already was.

But something about seeing her so vulnerable in his classroom had oh-so-slightly shifted his assessment of her. Something about her goody-two-shoes ambitious-student vibe felt almost earnest.

"Fine," she was deftly backing away from them, weakly smiling. "Any time sounds absolutely fine! I can make anything work!"

"You sure?" they looked at her strangely.

"Oh yeah! Sorry. Gotta go. Have—" her eyes roved and she saw his nameplate on his office door. "Have a meeting with my professor! He’s very strict."

"Nathan? He’s a TA you know. In Kelly's grad classes. She doesn't stop raving about him." Kelly was brilliant and sweet, and he’d dated her for a while, only to find she wasn’t quite as ambitious in life or as... experimental in bed as he was. He’d come from nothing. She was a trust fund baby. He craved an eager, trusting power exchange. She craved a hot piece of arm candy. They parted amiably, although hearing that she still spoke of him gave discomfort.

But he needed to focus. He would not struggle his whole life like his parents, and when he found a girl he wanted to be able to take care of her.

"Oh," Emeline said, with an almost- hysterical light laugh. "I didn't realize he was a grad student!" She backed away. Her legs were visibly trembling. He didn't know how the girls didn't take the hint and leave. So much for focus. He found himself transfixed, watching her shiver.

"He is kind of handsome." Her voice dropped. "And coming this way! Better go!"

They waved and finally moved down the adjacent hall, looking back at him before doing so, and passing some quiet judgment on his appearance and giggling after.

Emeline stood stiffly smiling after them as if to be sure they were actually leaving. Then she turned and ran for the bathroom.

It wasn’t three jagged steps before she started crumbling.

"Oh God," he heard her gasp. She faltered and began doubling over. "Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh—!"

He couldn't help it if he walked slightly faster, to get nearer, to see what was going on.

He saw a faint dark stain blossom on the back of her green skirt.

"Oh God, don't let this happen to me," she shrank to her knees. "Don't let this be happening..."

It was.

She was going. And she was going right here. And she was going right now.

She let out an audible sob— and a hiss of hot pee jetted down her leg.

The dark patch on the back of her skirt grew, and then visible rivulets trickled down both her legs, puddling on the floor.

She was pissing herself, right here in the hallway.

And it was one of the sexiest things he'd ever seen his life.

He stood, frozen, fighting a sudden and severe erection.

"Oh God!" she wailed, burying her face in her hands. The last trickles spilled from her relieved pussy and pattered on the floor.

She sat for a minute, in sheer mortification and disbelief, face covered, unable to look and see how many people were watching the most embarrassing accident of her life.

Finally, she lifted her head and looked. There was nobody up the hall. She looked back.

There was only him.

And he was undeniably caught looking.

Immediately her cheeks went the most alluring shade of mortified pink.

He did what he did, and took immediate control of the situation.

He came to her side. Her face crumpled as he did. "I can't walk back across campus like this," she sobbed.

"Come to my office. We'll figure something out."

At a loss, and helpless, she could only nod.

He extended a hand for her and she took it, letting him help her to her feet. He led the way into his office and flicked the lamp on. She hurried inside, desperate for no one to see her.

And she dissolved into tears.

"It's okay," he assured, a little stiffly.

Her nipples had hardened in her bra, and the outlines of them were visible through her sheer white shirt. "Do you have someone you can call?" He asked.

"My roommate I guess," she sniffled. "But I don't want her to see!"

"Well, we can give her a call and ask her to bring a change of clothes." That made her cry all the harder for some reason. "Or we could hang dry your skirt in front of my space heater." All the TA offices had them, to combat the freezing cold of their hallway.

She nodded, still sniffling. "I'd rather do that."

He lifted the space heater from behind his desk and brought it to the low table and plug-in by the door.

While he did so she numbly unfastened the buttons that lined the side of her skirt, and he tried not to be more aroused than he already was.

"I will turn around,"

"No," she sniffed, surprising him. "It’s okay. I won't inconvenience you in your own office any more than I already am."

She finished the last of her buttons and let her skirt fall to her ankles, and stepped out of it.

Her grey panties were soaked around the crotch area and he had to fight hard not to stare.

A beautiful girl was in his office, in her panties. And they were soaking.

He tried to recover quickly from the arousal and flicked the space heater onto high.

It warmed quickly, and he grabbed up a chair.

"You can put your skirt on this."

"Are you sure it's okay? I don't want to— " she shuddered in embarrassment. "I don't want to get my potty on your things."

The unexpected juvenile choice of the word had a strange, exciting effect on him. He swallowed and waved her concern away. "It's fine. Please. Go ahead."

She draped her skirt over the arm of the chair, in front of the glowing orange space heater.

They stood in silence for a moment, and she uncomfortably put a hand on her arm as if to console herself. Then, after a beat, she utterly surprised him by asking, "Should I take my panties off too?"

Chapter 4

It was erotic enough, her standing in his dimly-lit office in her clinging wet panties. But even the mention of her taking them off was enough to make his erection strain in his pants. He thought he felt small droplets of pre-cum oozing at his tip. God damn it.

"If you want them to dry too," he said lamely.

And she gave him a strange look, almost like one of knowing. Almost like, through her embarrassment, she knew what she was doing, and it was intentional.

"Okay," she said. Then, in a sultry soft tone.

"You don't have to look away."

She slid one finger beneath the waistband of her grey, damp panties, and then another. She was slow about tugging them away from her pussy and down her legs.

He nearly groaned.

Her pussy was shaved and naked, so naked he could see pink parts protruding from her slit, see her swollen clit. She tugged her panties all the way to her ankles, stepped out of them, and kept her legs apart like she was letting him get a good look of her vulnerable, painfully naked pussy.

She looked innocently up at him. "Do you have any tissues? To help me clean up?"

"Yes." His voice sounded raspy. He cleared his throat. "Yes. Let me grab them."

She hung her panties on the other arm of the chair, stooping a little to do so. When he turned from retrieving the tissues he got an eyeful of her perfect, pale bottom cheeks.

He extended the box to her and she accepted. Then...

She sat on his desk with her naked bottom, spread her legs, and began cleaning herself up. She wiped the dampness away delicately and he couldn't help but watch, transfixed.

She looked up at him.

And in a soft warm voice, she whispered, "I'm very wet."

Something about the tears still on her eyelashes as she said it... Good God.

He lifted the trash can and extended it to her. She dropped the tissues, looking very deliberately at him.

And then she looked down at the visible bulge in his pants.

"Are you hard for me?" she asked, brazenly.

He didn't answer.

He frankly couldn't believe this was happening.

She spoke softly, wistfully, as if in reflection. "If your dick was out you could just..." she spread her legs a little. And you could hear the soft sound of her wet arousal. "Slide it right in."

Dear. Holy. God.

"You are not a little goody-two-shoes," he said breathlessly.

She looked at him, with strangely intoxicating, bland, cold eyes. "Is that what you thought I was?"

And he wasted no time advancing on her. He approached her at the desk, and her hungry eyes held a spark of anticipation in them.

"Are you sure you know what you're asking for?" he asked, raggedly.

"You said it yourself," she whispered. "I'm not always good."

And he needed no more prompting.

He kissed her. Her pink lips were soft and eager.

And while he kissed her he unbuckled, unbuttoned, and unzipped his pants.

He liked that she gasped a little when he eased his dick free. He'd always known he was large. But the not-so-innocent-girl taking him in with rapt eyes was a powerful intoxicant. There were indeed beads of moisture already forming at his tip and oozing down his head. He unbuttoned his shirt and let it fall, and liked the way she stared at his toned chest.

"Do it," she gasped, parting her legs for him.

"Slide it in?"

"Yes!" she gasped. "I have an IUD. Do it."

And he did, first easing his tip into her, and then thrusting deep.

She gasped.

She was wet, soaking wet. And all for him.

"Have you imagined this before?" he asked.

"Every girl in our class has," she shivered and shut her eyes. Then she opened them, to smile slyly at him. "I'm just the only one brave enough to act on it."

He had grossly underestimated her.

He thrust deep and she groaned. And together they built up a fierce rhythm of thrusting, her bottom bouncing on the desk.

Behind her blouse, he could see her little breasts bouncing too.

He wanted to see more.

"Let me see your tits," he gasped suddenly.

Still thrusting, she began unfastening the buttons of her white shirt, rapidly. She pried the shirt apart to reveal a startlingly sexy lacy grey bra. He savored, for a minute, watching her breasts jiggle like that, clasped in her bra.

But he wanted to see her hardened little nipples.

She tortured him a little longer, groaning and thrusting like that, before finally tugging her shirt off. He reached behind her and unhooked her bra in rapid time.

She gasped and laughed a little. "I'm not dating undergrads anymore," she snorted. "Not after this."

He didn't lift the cups away from her breasts yet.

"You learn all sorts of things in grad school."

She laughed.

He liked making her laugh. He liked the way her eyes glittered whenever she looked at him.

Her eye makeup was a little smudged from her early embarrassment and tears, and he liked that too. He'd like to make her desperate and watch her cry and console her with a good slick fucking, and he'd like to do it over and over again...

He tugged the bra away from her, revealing her perfect pale breasts.

Her little nipples were hard and pink and perfect.

He lowered his head to lick them— and made her instantly squirm.

"Oh my God," she arched physically. "That feels... so good..."

And then he pulled out.

And he lowered his head between her legs.

"Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, wait!" she gasped, jumping in surprise. "It's just... I haven't... I haven't a lot of guys... really any guys... go down on me."

He peered up at her. "You date a lot of boys don't you?" She didn't deny it, and the fact privately thrilled him. It would be exciting to show her what it was like to be with a man.

He let his tongue glide over her and she gasped and writhed a little.

Exposing her to that pleasure for the first time was deeply, profoundly erotic.

He let his tongue glide over the delicate nub that was her clit and delighted in her moan.

"You... know just how to touch me..."

His very thorough knowledge of female anatomy was worth the whole price of his education. He spent some time thrusting with his tongue, savoring her eager juices, tonguing her clit, and becoming increasingly hard at the sound of her moaning, and the sensation of her writhing under his touch.

"Come into me from behind?" she asked, breathless.

"I'd be happy to." He stood and tugged her down.

She turned, putting her hands on the desk for support, and extended her bottom half for him.

He rubbed his dick against her soaking slit— and felt her stiffen.

"Oh," she gasped. "That feels good." But she said it half-heartedly like it wasn't what she actually wanted.

A strange feeling spiked in him.

She wouldn't be asking... would she?

"Did you have something else in mind?"

She seemed a little too embarrassed to answer. And then finally, she muttered, "I just always wondered what it would feel like to have a man come into me... from behind."

He was in complete and utter awe of her.

"You really aren't a goody-two-shoes."

"Shut up," she laugh-groaned in embarrassment.

He extracted his tip from her wet entry after a few more rubs to make sure it was soaking. He was thoroughly coated in her juices.

Then he lifted his tip to her tight pink asshole.

She whimpered a little, and he stared in awe to see her asshole tightening and quivering too.

This would be new territory for him, if not territory he'd often thought about. He couldn't help but feel that she looked so delicate, and his tip looked so big, tentatively rubbing up against her. She groaned in pleasure at the sensation though, and it gave him momentum to move forward.

He pressed firmly against her entry and was astonished to feel it give way. He pushed deeper.

She gasped, and her palms flattened on the desk, but she still kept her bottom exposed towards him, and she still didn't protest.

So, he probed in a little deeper, and she groaned with aching excitement as he did so.

He finally pushed his whole head into her— and she gasped in real pain.

"I'm sorry," he blurted. "I'll pull out."

"No!" she gasped, hands balling into fists on the table. "I'm just getting adjusted. I want you. I want this."

I want you. He hadn't anticipated the words or the effect they'd have on him. He plunged deeper, and she let out a small scream, but he also felt her anus accept him, pull him deeper in. He took a minute to adjust to this new tightness and then began to build up the slowest friction.

She gasped with the small thrusting increments, and she grunted as they slowly, surely, became more insistent.

By now he was feverish with ache for her. And all kinds of fantasies struck him, of watching her make a puddle, of watching her wet for him, then lifting her soaking skirts, and coming into her from behind while she wept in embarrassment...

Her more insistent squeaks brought him back to the present.

He realized that with one hand she had begun to stroke her clit as he thrust into her. He liked that. He could only imagine how her little tits were bouncing, and he wanted to see them. He wanted to see her on top of him. Under him. Her mouth on him. Everywhere. All the time.

How fast opinions can change.

"Come in me," she gasped, rubbing herself into a fury. She was so slick that he could hear her finger gliding over her pussy. That was enough to push him almost to the edge.

He thrust harder, the desk audibly creaking beneath them.

And then she whispered, "I want you to see me embarrassed all the time, and fuck me senseless all the time, and see me cry, and make it better..."

"Oh my God— " he came with a white-hot spurt, pumping her prone asshole with seed and she let out a small scream, pushing herself to her own edge too, furiously rubbing on her pussy. As his last pumps of cum came, she reached her own screaming frenzy, and he didn't care if anybody heard as she came with cries of pleasure.

The aftermath of her cries buzzed in his ears, and as he slid out from behind her, he watched his cum drip down her ass and nearly grew erect all over again.

"Clean me?" she whispered, hands still on the desk, trembling.

"Oh, gladly." He could stand to clean her up for the rest of his life.

He produced the box of tissues and wiped his cream from her bottom, savoring the shapely cheeks, and how her whole body quivered as she took breathless breaths in the aftermath of her climax.

The little good girl in his class.

Who would have ever known?

She turned to face him, tears still drying on her face.

"We have another big test next week, don't we?" she asked.

"We do," he said, unsure where this utter change in subject was going. "Which I know everyone hates my guts for."

"Well too bad for them. I'll come prepared."

She sidled up to him, pressing her breasts tenderly against his chest. "I'll sit in the front row this time, to make sure you see me squirming."

Meet Melody

Hi, my name is Melody! I have all kinds of awful fantasies. I also like to get desperate and wet in my panties.

This story was inspired by an encounter I had with a fellow TA in grad school. We hated each other's guts at first. Then, after a gathering involving a lot of alcohol, we ended up hurrying back to campus for me to use the bathroom... and ultimately ended up in his office, having one of the steamiest encounters of my life.

Needless to say, we didn't hate each other's guts too much after that.

I loved the experience so much, I wanted it immortalized in some way. This one's for you, Ross.
