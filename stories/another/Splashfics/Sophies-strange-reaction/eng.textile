Sophie's strange reaction

Author: SplashFics

1.

Hay fever season was in full swing... Sophie's red eyes and itchy throat had been under siege since morning and she was desperate for anything to help soothe her symptoms as she staggered into the high street chemist.

As hard as it was to see through her irritated eyelids, there was no mistaking, once she located the aisle she needed, that where there should have been an assortment of allergy relief on offer, there were only empty shelves and sold out signs to be found. No expletive would have sufficed to sum up her boiling frustration and while her tears did help take away some of the itchiness, Sophie knew she had to find a solution or face the real possibility of going insane in a hurry. Tomorrow couldn't come soon enough. She couldn't bear to wait so long for a restock and left the chemist barely able to stop herself from lashing out at the nearest bystander.

Panicking and rubbing at her eyes now that she found herself again exposed to the beating sun and relentless clouds of pollen, Sophie looked up and down the high street hoping for a miracle. Since she'd started University, she'd been up and down that road a thousand times and could navigate it blindfolded. She knew every shop, inside and out, on both sides of the road and precisely what each one of them sold. Not a single one would have hay fever remedies. Not even that weird, blurry shop right across the way with a faded green cross above the door…

'Hang on...' Sophie wondered, 'has that always been there?'

Hiding in the shadow of a tree, an ancient looking shop front with a wooden sign, covered in intricately painted green words that Sophie could just about understand appeared to have squeezed itself between the neighbouring buildings like some bizarre otherworldly fissure.

As sketchy as it seemed, she was ready to try anything and her legs marched towards the shop with no hesitation. Sliding back the wooden door frame, Sophie stepped inside and immediately noticed a peculiar smell in the air. Along the walls, she saw jar after jar of inexplicable, curiously coloured objects and felt herself losing touch with reality, but if just one of those mysterious things could stop her eyes burning and put an end to the endless sneezing, she wasn't going to turn around until she found it.

A small woman sat behind a cash register. She'd noticed Sophie come in and welcomed her without leaving her seat. It was like she knew why Sophie was there and cracked a knowing smile as she watched her raise her forearm to catch yet another sneeze.

'I know what it is you seek,' the woman croaked, hopping down from her chair suddenly.

Sophie was impressed, though it didn't require a great deal of skill to deduce she was on the verge of keeling over.

'Come,' the woman said, beckoning Sophie through to the back room.

Sophie followed and was led into a small workshop with more shelves, jars and a large table where, it appeared, the shopkeeper blended together her concoctions. As the woman reached the table, she turned to her bleary eyed customer and scanned her from head to toe. Without another word, she faced the nearest shelf and took down a white bottle. Using a few drops to line her mortar, she then drew from within her sleeve a handful of brittle leaves which she then crumbled over the oily substance. Sophie noticed the smell with a shudder the moment it reached her nostrils. It was such a foul odour that she could smell it despite her blocked nose and she closed her eyes in disgust. The woman ground away with her pestle, adding a few more ingredients along the way and within a couple of minutes, let Sophie know that she was finished and to please return to the front of the shop.

'Gladly,' Sophie mumbled under her breath and made her way to the till, reaching into her handbag to find her purse.

She looked up to see on the counter a small jar filled with a fantastic, fluorescent liquid.

'You are to take exactly one tea spoonful every half an hour until the jar is empty... Thirteen pounds, if you please...'

With the putrid smell still fresh in her memory, Sophie wasn't especially keen to part with her cash, but desperation had twisted her arm to such a degree that she was soon handing over two crisp notes and heading for the exit with her dubious medicine in a paper bag.

'Just a second.'

As she reached the door, Sophie heard the woman call out - clearly she wasn't finished with her yet.

'What is it?' Sophie asked.

'Make sure to follow all directions...' the woman said with no hint of humour in her voice.

'Erm... Yeah, sure, I will,' Sophie said, managing a smile as she tucked the jar in her handbag and left.

The moment Sophie got in that evening, before she kicked off her shoes or even thought about getting ready for a night out with the girls, she grabbed the paper bag out of her handbag and tore it open. Her eyes were burning more fiercely than they had all day and she was keen to sample her medicine in the hope that it would allow her to enjoy herself later. She looked at the jar and wondered how many doses she was going to need to take, imagining herself having to excuse herself every half hour to measure out a spoonful at the bar…

'Gosh I'm going to look ridiculous...' she thought aloud, then with a shrug of her shoulders decided to throw caution to the wind.

'...Stuff it, it's probably useless anyway.'

Sophie popped the cork and drained the entire jar in a few gulps. It tasted almost as terrible on her tongue as in her nostrils and she started retching. In throes of discomfort and trying her best to keep the liquid down, Sophie noticed, tucked inside the paper bag a small piece of folded paper.

'Oh yeah...' she coughed, wiping tears from her eyes.

Once she'd composed herself, she unfolded the discoloured note and gave it a scan. There was a long list of directions that she quickly realised she had not followed...


1. Not to be taken all at once.

2. Not to be taken on an empty stomach.

3. Not to be taken, or mixed with alcohol.

Without bothering to read the potential side effects listed below, Sophie laughed and tossed the note back inside the bag.

'Whoops.'

She hadn't eaten since breakfast and tonight was Poppy's nineteenth birthday…

'I suppose I can teetotal it...' she compromised begrudgingly.

But with friends like Sophie's, such a compromise would be an achievement indeed.

At seven on the dot, Sophie grabbed her keys and left her room. Sam met her at the end of the corridor and together they made the fifteen minute walk to a student bar not far from campus.

The other two hadn't arrived yet, so feeling responsible, Sophie decided to order herself a glass of water while they waited.

'Water??' asked Sam, her face full of surprise.

'Ugh I know...' grumbled Sophie, 'I took some medicine earlier, can't have anything strong!'

'Well, you could stretch to an orange juice at least, no?'

Sophie laughed.

'Yeah, sure why not!'

They ordered the drinks and waited a couple more minutes before Laura and birthday girl Poppy arrived.

'Hiya Sam, Soph! Sorry we're late!' Poppy apologised as she received a hug from each.

Laura noticed the two glasses of orange juice on the table and was appalled.

'I hope there's vodka in those!' she teased.

'No, we're being good tonight!' Sam laughed, nudging Sophie's arm.

'Stuff that, you can count me out!' replied Laura defiantly, 'We're getting sloshed tonight... Isn't that right?'

'Absolutely!' Poppy agreed, 'I really fancy a cocktail... In fact, as it's my birthday I'll get one for everyone, no arguments!'

Poppy's family being so well off, she was always happy to 'share the love' at the bar and her friends were always happy to receive it in abundance, but Sophie knew she'd have to moderate herself tonight... But before she was able to speak up, Poppy had strode off towards the bar. Sam turned to her and asked if it was alright.

'Well, I mean... Who could turn down a screaming orgasm?' she shrugged.

'Not me!' Sam laughed and the next moment Poppy was returning with a glass for everyone at the table.

It had only taken a handful of minutes, but Sophie was about to violate the third and final rule on the list. She licked her lips and took a first sip, initially feeling apprehensive, but then with each sip, loosening up until the promise she'd made to herself became a distant and fading memory.

Three rounds later, all was forgotten... Whether it was the medicine kicking in, or perhaps the fresher evening air moving in through the bar's windows, Sophie's symptoms began to die down and she felt as calm and comfortable as if she'd never even known suffering.

After the cocktails, they moved onto beer and it was Sophie's turn to buy a round.

'Right, I need a wee, so I'll come with you, Soph.'

Sam was on her feet and shuffling around to Sophie's side of the table. Sophie grabbed her purse and decided she'd follow her into the ladies before buying the drinks.

'God I'm bursting, I hate my bladder,' moaned Sam as she went into one of the stalls.

Sophie didn't much need to go she thought, but sat down in the neighbouring cubicle anyway. To her surprise, as soon as her bare bottom touched the toilet seat, she felt a dull, heavy ache inside her pelvis that suggested she needed to go a lot more than she realised. Before Sam had even started peeing next door, Sophie was letting rip. It rushed out of her like she was the more desperate of the two and her face flushed a deep shade of red. Sam, to her benefit, hadn't noticed and focused instead on relieving her own bladder, which at this point had begun emptying itself with more than enough intensity to rival Sophie's.

'Auhh... I needed that...' Sam moaned.

She peed abundantly for twenty seconds or so, then her stream began to recede and trickle away. Sophie on the other hand, was still going at full force and feeling more self-conscious by the second. At the rate she was peeing, she wondered if she might make it to one minute - a feat she'd only rarely accomplished under extreme strain and with considerably less force…

'God, you had to go, Soph!'

Sam flushed her toilet and had stepped outside to find Sophie still peeing in her stall.

'Apparently!' Sophie replied. She was quite lost for words, but on the stroke of a minute felt herself begin to taper off and her pee start to die down. Sam had finished washing and drying her hands when Sophie eventually joined her at the sinks.

'Not sure where that came from!' she said, her face still deep red.

Once she too had washed her hands, Sophie and Sam returned to the bar and bought the next round of beers. Sophie was still surprised by how much she'd peed, but thought less about it as she slipped further and further under the influence. As they finished the second round of beer, she felt herself tingling for another wee and was grateful to hear Laura verbalise the same desire.

'The seal's broken now I guess,' Sophie shrugged.

Sam appeared to also need the loo once more, but not wanting to leave Poppy on her own, agreed to wait for them to come back before she went herself.

This time, Sophie had no doubt she needed to pee and was a lot less at ease as she and Laura made their way through the bar. When they arrived at the ladies', they noticed one of the stalls was already occupied.

'It's fine, you can go first,' Laura said with a grin.

Clearly she'd noticed how urgent Sophie was and let her enter the nearest cubicle before her. Not wasting a moment, Sophie locked the door, bared her bottom again and let her relief spray loudly into the bowl.

'Auhh... Thanks Laur...'

'Not a problem, Soph...' Laura replied, convinced by the sound of her gushing that it was the fairest decision.

Sophie peed with as much passion as she had earlier. Her bladder ached just the same and her stream crashed equally as heavily into the bowl. The woman in the neighbouring stall, who had long finished what she was doing, unlocked the door and allowed Laura to enter a good minute after Sophie had started. To the surprise of everyone present, her solitary pee was still very audibly under way and she continued to stir up the water even as Laura sat down.

'Jesus, Sophie!' she said once the woman had left, 'It's a really good thing I let you in first, huh!'

'Auhhh...' Sophie moaned, unable to properly articulate herself and unsure what to say even if she could.

Laura began peeing the next moment. Despite her shock, she was undoubtedly keen to go and the water beneath her churned with respectable vigour. Her pee beamed hard and strong for the best part of a minute and she sighed with satisfaction once it came to an end, but nextdoor, Sophie was gushing as hard as ever. She carried on for thirty more seconds that felt twice as long and finally, as another woman entered the ladies', she topped out and trickled to a halt.

Sparing Sophie the embarrassment of any comments while the other woman was in earshot, Laura instead eye balled her as they washed their hands at the sinks a moment later. Well aware that she'd just taken a quite astounding pee, Sophie expected nothing less and shrugged her shoulders bashfully.

Back at their table, Sam, who had been waiting impatiently, greeted Sophie and Laura's return with a sigh of relief.

'Ugh, finally!' she moaned, 'Come on, Poppy!'

Sam dragged Poppy by the arm, more desperate than even she, who hadn't been to the toilet all night.

'Go easy, Sam!' Poppy laughed, doing her best to protect her glass from spilling.

Clearly she was in no hurry and stopped for a moment to finish the last of her beer. Sophie laughed along, but as she watched Poppy slurp down her beverage, she felt a familiar tingle in her nether regions. Realising at once what it meant, her face straightened.

'A - Actually, I need to go again. Poppy do you mind if I nip ahead of you?'

'You what??' shouted Laura.

Sophie knew it was bizarre after the performance she'd just put on, but her bladder was already feeling as full as it had been not even five minutes ago. Squeezing her knees together, she apologised to Poppy, who waved her on nonchalantly and she headed back to the loo for the third time that evening.

Finding only one available stall when they entered the ladies', Sophie was tempted to barge Sam out of the way and claim it for herself - she was that desperate, but Sam had other ideas and dipped ahead of her at the last moment. As she locked the door and sat down on the toilet, Sophie bit her lip and leaned against the sinks, hoping it wouldn't be too long before she could get back in there.

Sam peed with typical energy for the next thirty seconds. Sophie's eyes watered with anticipation the entire time and stared desperately at both the locked stalls.

'Come on, come on...' she whispered as she heard the roll of toilet paper and then finally the click of the lock as Sam emerged from her stall.

As fate would have it, the other stall also became available at this time, but Sophie zipped inside the one nearest to her and yanked down her clothes. The next moment, anyone would have thought there were three taps running in the ladies' toilet, as Sophie's stream jetted against the porcelain, competing with the women washing their hands.

'Mmhh...' she moaned, luxuriating in her relief.

The competition with the taps soon became no contest. Sophie outlasted them both and was still gushing hard as the woman left Sam on her own to wait for her friend.

'Didn't you just go only a minute ago, Sophie?' she asked, '... because it really doesn't sound like it.'

Indeed Sophie was peeing like she hadn't been all night and no one was more aware of that fact than she. But it wouldn't stop racing out of her and three minutes after she'd sat down, it continued to come.

'Give me a moment, Sam. I think I'm nearly finished...'

'Are you sure though?' Sam responded, almost laughing.

Sophie had peaked and what seemed like the last few drops were now trickling into the bowl, but as soon as she thought she might have been close to empty, she felt the weight return to her bladder and an almighty wave of pee surged out.

'Auhh... Actually no... I'm not...'

She was gushing again with reckless abandon and carried on in the same manner for half a minute before the stream died away once more.

'Err, look, Sam. You don't have to wait for me, I think I'll stay here a bit longer and make sure I get everything out.'

'Are you sure?' asked Sam, still laughing, but feeling a bit sorry for Sophie.

'Yeah, don't worry, I'll be back as soon as!'

'Okay then! See you in a bit,' Sam chirped and a moment later, she left the ladies' and went to rejoin the others at the table.

Sophie sat and squeezed as hard as she could, attempting to expel anything her bladder might have been holding onto. She couldn't feel any particular urge at that time and more often than not, nothing came out, but every now and then she'd notice a tingle that would lead to a trickle and then the pee would gush for a minute or so before stopping. It was tiring, but she wanted to be sure she was completely empty before returning to the bar. After five minutes of this repetitive routine, Sophie noticed someone enter the ladies' toilets.

'Soph, are you in there?'

It sounded like Poppy.

'Oh, hi Poppy. Yeah, it's me.'

'Are you alright?' Poppy asked.

'Yeah, no worries, I just drank too much! I think my bladder was a bit full, that's all.'

She laughed and Poppy did too before entering the neighbouring stall.

'I can certainly relate,' she said as Sophie heard the rustle of her dress.

The next moment Poppy was peeing and a clear and confident stream struck noisily into her bowl, resonating through the stall divider and reaching Sophie's ears.

'You know, my friends used to call me Posh Poppy at school because I'd never go to the toilet. They thought it was because I was secretly a member of the royal family and that using common toilets was against royal protocol or some story, but obviously that was all a load of rubbish!'

Sophie laughed again as Poppy continued.

'Anyway one day I wanted to show them I wasn't too posh to use the toilet at school and that I just never needed to go, so I remember during lunch I drank the entire jug of squash on our table and then the jug on the next table down and told everyone I'd go for a wee at the end of the day. Of course I was bursting by the time we were let out and I raced to the toilets and showed them all I was just as common as they were... The only problem was I was so bursting, my little exhibition went on much longer than I'd expected and they all had to go home before I even finished! My mum ended up sending one of the teachers when she arrived to collect me and I wasn't there... It was an absolute nightmare!'

'Ha ha, get out! No way!' Sophie laughed. 'You're joking aren't you?'

'No word of a lie,' giggled Poppy.

They continued giggling at Poppy's story and Sophie felt grateful to her for trying to make her feel better. The entire time she'd been talking, her confident pee had continued to cascade with some volume and it really added an element of authenticity to the tale.

'So I'm guessing it always takes you a long time?' Sophie asked some minutes later.

'It does indeed,' Poppy replied casually, 'but if you're finished, I can wrap it up over here too?'

'You - is that alright?' asked Sophie.

'Oh, I only came to keep you company really, I wasn't bursting or anything...'

'Wow, um... Well, I think I am finished. Let me see...'
