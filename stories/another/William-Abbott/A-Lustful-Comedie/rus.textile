A LUSTFUL COMEDIE

Author: William Abbott

A Shakespearian sonnet? I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me. But once I got the iambic pentameter in my head, I just couldn't get rid of it until I got it down on paper.

My wife NEVER makes fun of me for my sexual kink, but she teased me mercilessly about my rhyming couplets. "Shakespeare never used rhyming couplets," she assured me. "Except at the end of a scene. Or in a sonnet. And don't you dare write a sonnet!"

So of course I had to.

A LUSTFUL COMEDIE

A sonnet like those written by the bard Begins this evening’s lustful comedie About a man who’s longing for a kiss From his lass, who’s desperate for a piss. She wore my favorite flowing cotton dress With the skirt that billowed in the breeze And the halter top that showed her breasts And the hem so short it seemed to tease With promises of what it might reveal If coaxed by zephyr’s mischievous delight.

All night I watched her, and my eyes were peeled, Anticipating such a tasty sight.

She held my hand all through the midnight show Until she whispered, “Tell me what I miss

When I get back; I really have to go.

I’m bursting now, I’ve really got to piss.”

But then the gripping denouement began.

“On second thought, I’ll wait here while I can.”

The movie ended and the lights went up

And I remarked how large her empty cup.

“If I’d been smart,” she said, “If I’d been wise,

I would have asked for one of smaller size.

I drank it all right down to slake my thirst

And now my bladder feels like it will burst.”

It took forever, from the far-back row

To make our way up front. She had to go

So bad she hopped and danced and said out loud, “I have to go! Please hurry up!” But still the crowd Could only shuffle forward at a pace

That made her dance and squirm and jog in place. At last we reached the lobby, but we saw

Lines were backed up out the restroom doors.

A dozen or more women waited there

And as many men. She stood and stared

Aghast, and crossed her legs, and then she swore. “I have to go right now. Let’s try next door.” She took my hand. I followed her swift flight Through the exit doors into the night.

We hurried down the walk and did not stop

Until we stood before the coffee shop

Which up until that time we’d always thought Was open all night long, but we were caught By our mistake, for it was closed, you see

And she was dying for a place to pee.

She skipped and scampered back to stand in line, Fast as she could, but only then to find

The doors were locked, with no way back inside. She tugged on them to no avail. She sighed. “Let’s go downtown,” I said, “and then we’ll find A bathroom you can use, where they won’t mind.” “All right,” she said, taking my hand, “let’s go.

My bladder feels as if it will explode.

Find me someplace, please, and find it fast.

There’s a limit to how long I’ll last.”

We got into the car and drove away

While she held on with all her strength and prayed.

Very lightly, it began to rain

And she moaned, as if she were in pain.

Soon the streets were wet, the streetlights shone Reflected in the pavement, and she moaned, “I have to go!” and wriggled all around As more raindrops from the sky came down.

We drove downtown, but all the shops were closed,

And all the restaurants where we’d supposed We could stop in and use the bathrooms there Were closed and dark, and she was in despair. “I can’t hold on! I’m going to wet myself

Before much longer! Find me someplace! Help!”

I pointed out, across the street, a park,

A little square with shadows deep and dark.

“I’ll keep you safe,” I promised. “I’ll stand guard.” (The thought of it was making me so hard.)

She looked into the darkness, deep in thought. “It’s too open for me just to squat,

My skirt hiked up, my panties round my knees.

Any passerby would see me pee.”

“Then take them off,” I said. “Leave them behind

And sit beside me there. No one will mind.”

Even in the dark, I saw she blushed

But she pulled them off in such a rush.

I killed the engine and we stepped outside.

We weren’t alone; there was no place to hide

But in the park, the shadows of the trees

Might still hide a woman as she pees.

The crosswalk was a few yards up ahead

But as we got to it, the light turned red.

We waited, and she danced with gritted teeth

In her dress with nothing underneath

Until the wind came howling through the trees

Rustling and shaking all the leaves

And lifting them, and lifting too her dress

Which she hurried to smooth down, in some distress.

And then the thunder came, and then began

The heavy rain to fall, and so we ran

For shelter ’neath an awning with some others Who huddled there as well, looking for cover From the sudden heavy pelting rain.

She looked at me. Her jaw was clenched in pain.

I swear, she would have pissed herself right there Except the others would have seen and stared. She held me tight, and crossed her legs and danced

And asked herself when she would get the chance

To let it go, to pee upon the ground

And let the rain drown out the splashing sound. Just then the rain let up—a brief respite But long enough to run—not left, but right, Not to the shadows of the trees, so dark, But back again to where my car was parked. “Open it up!” she cried. I had my key

And as I turned it, I couldn’t help but see The rain had made her dress (it was so thin) Translucent, so that I could see her skin. “Just take me home,” she said, and in the seat

She crossed her legs, determined not to leak.

“You didn’t pee?” I asked. “You’re just as wet

From rain. You might as well...” She said, “Not yet.

Not here. I can’t in front of all of them.

I’ll just have to hang on ’til we’re home!”

“I’ll get us home,” I said, “but buckle first.”

“OK,” she said. “My God, I’m gonna burst!”

She doubled over, and with both her hands

She gripped herself, and took her underpants

And crushed them tight into a ball to press Against herself, down there under her dress. We drove like that, for twenty minutes, fast,

With no good places anywhere we passed

For her to run and hide and squat and pee

No matter how incredible her need.

Rocking back and forth the whole way home,

Holding her crotch in agony, she moaned, Until at last we turned onto my street.

But then the hail began to pound and beat

Upon the car—huge stones. Her eyes went wide.

She had to go so bad, I thought she’d cry.

We waited there a minute, maybe two,

Until at last the worst of it was through.

The hail let up, and the rain had ceased,

And I wondered, would she find release

Out on the lawn, or try to get inside

Into a bathroom that would let her hide

Her deluge, her own torrential rain,

Letting go at last, but without shame?

I got out and ran around the car

To open up her door. It wasn’t far

To get across the lawn and to the door

But still she sat there, rocking back and forth. “If I try to move, then I’m done for,”

She said. “I’ll never make it to the door.”

Her eyes were clearly on the edge of tears.

“It’s OK, then. You can pee right here.

It’s dark. No one is home across the street.

As open as we are, it’s quite discreet.

No one will see. No one will ever know.

Come on. Come here, now. Just stand up and go.” “No, no!” she said. “I’ve come as far as this.

Just one more minute! God, let me hold my piss!

I’m just not sure if I can walk and still

Hold on, but if I find I can, I will!”

“Then let me carry you,” I said. “Come here.

Put your arms around my neck, my dear.

I’ll hold you in my arms and set you down

Once we reach the bathroom safe and sound.”

I lifted her and held her tenderly.

She crossed her legs. Her face against my chest,

She writhed and squirmed and held on desperately

For just a little longer, but at last

Was overcome. I felt her water flow

Against my arm. I felt her body’s heat

Run down my leg and soak into my clothes.

“Oh God! I’m sorry! Set me on my feet.”

I kissed her then, and told her “It’s all right.

Just let it go. I love you just like this.”

I held her closer, squeezed her very tight While, uncontrollably, her water hissed. My own arousal swelling as she peed;

My own desire equaling her need.

In the dark, I lay her on the ground Still wet with rain as well as with her pee.

I raised her dress up to her waist and found Her body lying naked just for me.

She was shy at first, with us outside

But she liked my kisses, and agreed

That it was dark enough for us to hide

Our lovemaking, as much as when she peed.

I touched her thigh, my fingers on her hips

And kissed her belly, whispering her name, And then explored her softness with my lips And licked her tender place until she came While, thrusting hard against the ground below, I felt my own hot passion overflow.
