Walk Home

Prologue

As she was pulling into the parking site at the largest supermarket in town, she felt her bladder tingle. A part of her now wished she had used the toilet before embarking on the weekly grocery shopping.

But how urgent would her need to pee become? This morning, she had had quite some milk in her cereal, drank two glasses of fresh garden fruit smoothie – there were just so many fruit in her garden – and later she had slowly sipped through the contents of two bottles of mineral water whilst going about the normal house work. Too late she realized now that this comprised quite a quantity of liquid which had been slowly filtering through her system since.

The last speed bump – the movement vibrated through her bladder, making her feel the amount of urine which had been increasing quickly. Maybe she shouldn’t have gone to the hair dresser? She had had to wait quite a while until it was her turn. And the elaborate hair style she had been sold had taken an hour to do… But she knew her husband would like it, so it was right she had done it.

She parked the car and got a shopping cart. Somehow, the tingle in her bladder didn’t feel uncomfortable, she thought. Actually, it was rather pleasant how her filling bladder pushed against her panties. She had never before noticed this. With her thoughts revolving around this discovery, she forgot about her idea to look for a customer’s restroom as she entered the store.

Only two items to go and she would have worked through her shopping list! At the thought of this, she remembered her full bladder. She had been completely oblivious to her growing need to pee as she roamed aisles, scanning the shelves for special offers. In the meantime, her kidneys had released more and more freshly filtered urine into her bladder, increasing the pressure slowly but constantly. Could she have postponed the stop at the mail office? But no, her mom was urgently waiting for the family pictures. She remembered how in the morning she had spent half an hour in the queue just to send them – why didn’t they ever open more tills at this branch?

The tingle in her abdomen was getting more intense by the minute. Quickly to the till and then home! She was looking for the relief of emptying her bladder now – the pleasantness she had felt earlier was slowly fading even as she tried to focus on it. Why did the queue have to be so long? It appeared as if it wasn’t moving at all. She was getting frustrated: why couldn’t the service be better?

Waiting, she had time to concentrate on her growing need. It was quite urgent now. But somehow, it still felt oddly good. Clenching her sphincter muscle tighter, she realized how this not only helped her stem the flow but also moved her clitoris relative to her labia. Somehow, she liked the feeling of it.

Growing up in a rather restrictive, conservative environment, she had never really explored her body. Only by accident – or because her husband had requested it – she had little by little found out how pleasant the occupation with her body could be. But this had always been in the safe privacy of home and in the context of sexual intercourse. Her new discovery didn’t belong to this set of experiences.

“This cannot be true!” she thought. She couldn’t be turned on by trying to hold in her pee? Certainly, nature would not have mingled disparate functions as this! She tried again, clenching the muscles in her pelvic region and releasing again: Yes, she could feel the stimulation again. Was she supposed to like this? What did this reaction of her body tell her? What was it good for? A sudden urge to pee interrupted her thoughts. She bent over and clenched her muscles tighter; trying to retain the appearance of dignity and nonchalance she was used to by rummaging about the groceries in her cart.

Had there been this excitingly sexual, pleasant feeling again? She wasn’t sure: she had been concentrating too much on preserving her appearance. Her bladder started to actually ache rather than just tingle, distracting her attention. Nevertheless, her curiosity had been aroused and she tried again, focusing on the pleasant feeling the clenching and relaxing of her pelvic muscles caused in her vulva.

By the time it was her turn at the till, she had stimulated herself to quite a level of sexual arousal without being aware of it. Automatically, she put her shop on the checkout belt, her mind still analyzing the newfound function of her body.

“Eighty-three twenty-five, please” she was interrupted by the cashier.

Blushing, she realized how her nipples were poking through her bra and visibly stood out on her dress. How embarrassing! She had never indulged in sexual feelings in public, ever. She knew how hard her nipples would get and how their shape would be visible through almost any kind of fabric. How could she let herself go like this! Quickly, she threw a glance around. Did anyone notice? Apparently not – no-one was looking at her as she took her groceries from the till and got out her wallet. As was her habit, she paid in cash and pocketed the change, then removed the last items from the checkout, placing them in her cart.

Quickly, she left the store. She wanted to avoid anyone seeing her hard nipples poking through her clothing. Only when she sat in the car, she felt safe again. And only now she realized she had spent an hour in the store. Was it four hours now since she last used the loo? This brought her attention back on her full bladder, aching to release the flood of pee collected inside. How could she forget about that! But now she was sitting in the car and would be home soon. No need to humiliate herself hurrying back into the store and asking for a customer’s toilet!

Briskly driving out of her parking spot, she felt a jolt of pain in her bladder as she took the first speed bump. She clenched her sphincter muscle to avoid her urethra giving way to any liquid pressing to leave her bladder. Immediately, she had to think about the pleasure she had experienced with this trick and got horny again. A pang of conscience reminded her of her good upbringing – she should not indulge in this kind of feelings, especially not in public! A twinge of pain shook her body as she was taking the next speed bump.

This was the real reason she was clenching tight! Her bad conscience relaxed. She was desperate to pee: there was nothing unseemly about that, as long as she didn’t show it. She really needed to take a piss soon! The pressure in her bladder was reaching critical levels, constantly bringing her to the verge of wetting her panties as she drove along. She tried to hold her muscles contracted as long as possible before she relaxed them for a short break. But she couldn’t help it: every time she did this, she remembered the lust this had created earlier and she felt her body shudder with pain and pleasure alike.

It didn’t take long, and these feelings had taken control of her inexperienced mind again. She forgot about her desperation, and as she was driving past a discount store she decided to stop and see if they had any interesting offers. It was Thursday and they had just got this week’s delivery of specials, so there was a chance for real bargains.

Pushing the cart through the door she was greeted by the chill of air-conditioning. She felt how she got goose bumps, how her nipples firmed up and pushed against the fabric, drawing a boy’s eyes on her well rounded large breasts as he was leaving the store.

Now the full blast of the AC-outlet hit her and her bladder contracted. She was taken by surprise and almost lost control. She shouldn’t have stopped! Clenching her pelvic muscles as tight as she could she stemmed the flow starting to emerge from her urethra. There was no escape now: she had to follow the flow of customers, people pushing behind her to enter the store. In the twinkling of an eye, she found herself inside the store – there would be no way out but past the shelves and through the checkouts. Should she just do the tour and leave as quickly as possible?

She turned round to check the situation. From the corner of her eye, she saw the boy still standing in front of the shop. Was he looking at her? She wasn’t sure – somehow she felt so vulnerable by her need to pee and her poking nipples visible to everyone, she had the impression everyone was starring at her. Surely, the boy was just reading next week’s offers hanging in the window! A sudden urge made her bend over to avoid an accident. Her bladder was really filled to the brim with fresh urine! She couldn’t remember when she had been this desperate in public before. How could this have happened?

“Don’t give yourself away!” an inner voice admonished her, as she was holding herself.

She took her hands off her crotch and bent down further. She pretended to fiddle with her shoe laces, using her crossed thighs to press against her vulva. As she straightened up again, she caught the boys look again. Was he blushing as he quickly turned away? She remembered how her décolleté must have been exposed as she had bent down. She blushed, too: so the boy had really watched her? Had he noticed her distress? Or had he been gazing at her for a different reason?

Suddenly, the meaning of the thought of a young schoolboy watching her came to her. Was he sexually interested in her? Had he been starring at her breasts? This couldn’t be, she thought. She was probably twenty years older than he! But still, somehow, the thought turned her on. Her mind was too prepared for this kind of thoughts after the experiments she had performed with her pelvic muscles. It felt good to be someone’s sexual fantasy, she realized. Was it just imagination? Probably, she was just misinterpreting the situation! How could she be so focused on sexuality at the moment? This wasn’t her! She was confused about herself. Probing, she glanced back –the boy was still standing at the window, closer now, definitely starring into the shop. A hot wave shook her body – yes, he was starring at her. She had never felt so sexy and desirable before.

The pressure on her bladder had not ceased; and now a violent spasm brought her back to reality. She had to find a bathroom soon! She turned towards the aisle and directed her cart to the area with the temporary offers. Sure enough, there was a small TV on sale. It was a real bargain. Her niece would be visiting in two months’ time – she might as well get the TV for the guestroom now. She couldn’t offer a room without a decent TV to her niece, she thought.

Approaching the checkout area she heard an announcement: “Dear customers. We are sorry to inform you about a breakdown of our register scanning system. Our staff will have to enter the codes of the products manually for the next half hour. We can only open half the checkouts at a time to fix the hardware. Please excuse the inconvenience caused!”

It didn’t mean much to her until she realized she was last in a line of five customers with fully loaded carts. It took the cashier seemingly forever typing all the bar code numbers by hand as in the meantime she felt her desperation grow to almost unbearable levels.

She tried to focus on something else. But always her bladder managed to present its message in the forefront of her mind. The pleasant tingling was long gone, being replaced by a rather disagreeable twinge. She really needed to pee! She was desperate for a piss now – she realized she would not last much longer and started to look for a customer’s toilet. She could stare as much as she would; there was none to be found. These small discount shops were not obliged to provide public facilities and their low cost concept didn’t allow them to do it out of altruistic reasons.

Anxiously, she clung to her cart and watched the queue in front of her. It didn’t seem to move at all. A spasm pushed her urethra forward, only at the last moment she managed to clench it shut and avoid an accident. She felt the urge to touch herself, to put a hand in her crotch to force her bladder to contain its load of urine. The people in front of her moved a bit – the first customer had paid. Taking small steps, progressing as slowly as possible, she tried to prolong the time of distraction to forget about her humiliating need to pee. The next customer’s shopping had been processed quicker and she found herself progressing another meter or two.

The draught of an AC-outlet blew past her now. The chill increased the pressure on her bladder, she felt the urge to just let go and wet her panties. It would feel wonderful to just let go – like in the cold sea, when you went swimming and released your urine to warm the spot around you. She blushed at the thought. You weren’t supposed to urinate into the sea, either! She held on. She had to hold on; she was not going to humiliate herself in public, wetting herself. No, she was going to hold on, however desperate she might be. It was her own fault, after all!

Never should she have got herself in this situation – was it the arousal she had felt earlier that let her forget to go to the toilet at the supermarket? She felt her nipples stiffen, her breasts gently pulling up, as her skin formed goose bumps once again. She focused her concentration on these reactions of her body to the draught, trying to get her mind off the desperate need to empty her bladder, the urge to release the urine flood that was hiding inside her.

It helped – she was entirely focused on her shivering body now, felt her nipples rubbing the fabric of her bra, felt her dress softly caressing her skin. How long ago was it, since her husband had touched her like this? It seemed like an eternity since they had had intensive sex. Suddenly, she remembered how that schoolboy of maybe eighteen years had watched her as she entered the store. She imagined how he would be standing outside now, looking straight at her through the window and seeing her nipples erect in the cold. Would he know it wasn’t only the cold that was keeping them erect now? She felt a wave of pleasure shake her body as she remembered his stare.

His desire for her turned her on, made her aware of her stunningly well formed, large natural breasts, of her wide hips, how her light summer dress pronounced her hourglass figure. Warmth spread through her body, heat emanating from her vulva. She didn’t sense the cold draught anymore, she didn’t feel the desperation – it was just a pleasurable tingle, an excited horniness, a lustful desire that filled her now. She started to train her vulvar muscles again, to concentrate on the arousal the minute movements of her labia, her clitoris, of all parts of her vulva caused in combination with the fantasy of being desired by a young boy. How innocent had she been at his age, how easily had she been attracted by a smart guy!

Finally, she had paid the TV and loaded it into her car. As she sat on the driver’s seat, she felt wetness in her panties. She was shocked: Had she unconsciously lost control? Where did the wetness come from? Was she peeing herself? Had it been the spasm when she had entered the store? Immediately, the need to pee took control of her mind again. She had to fight hard not to lose control. A hand in her crotch, she was pressing against her vulva now to ease the pain of her full bladder. She felt urine pushing into her urethra and firmly clenched all muscles to keep it inside.

She got nervous. She must not wet the car! What would her family say! But she couldn’t pee anywhere near where she was, either. She had never liked peeing anywhere but into a toilet and here she was in the middle of the town in early afternoon. There was no way she could find a place to release her urine in a decent way which she would reach faster than home. She just had to pull herself together and master her body’s needs for a couple more minutes. But this wetness in her panties was distracting her. She just had to make sure she had not really peed herself already!

Glancing around, she made sure no-one was taking attention of her sitting in the car. Then she pulled up her dress and carefully touched her panties. Yes, they were moist! It came to her like a shock, even if she had felt it all along. She pulled her dress up further – she had to take a look. This couldn’t be true! Little was she aware that she already knew perfectly what had happened and that unconsciously she was seeking for an excuse to truly examine the situation. She opened her legs as far as possible in the limited space of the driver’s seat. Then she bent forward to look at her now uncovered white panties. Yes, they showed a small wet stain. Hesitatingly, she touched the panties with her hand, slightly rubbing up and down her slit.

“Feels good!” – this thought briefly shot into her conscience and vanished again. Still, she didn’t know the damage fully, yet. She would have to put her hand into her panties, she reasoned. Her dress was now pulled up to her bellybutton and tentatively, she put her hand into the seam of her panties. A quick glance outside: no-one was looking. She pulled down her panties a bit and lowered her hand into them further. Yes, her slit was definitely wet, she found as she gently rubbed along it. She probed a bit further. Where did the wetness come from? Was it pee? Her finger found its way into her vagina. It was wet – a slimy kind of wetness, she found. A sudden insight came to her: it was cum, she was wet with sexual arousal, and she was masturbating in public! It had nothing to do with pee, after all.

Hastily, she withdrew her hand and put her dress back in place. She was shocked at her own daringness. She wasn’t even used to masturbating at home, and sex had always been more of a means to please her husband than to create wonderful feelings for herself. And now she was caught in a spiral of arousal and craving for more she had not experienced in her life before. She was confused, as she started the car and pulled out of the parking. Her mind was spinning, she couldn’t hold on to any single thought. On the way home, she briefly had the impression to see the boy who had looked at her at the store – she was hallucinating in the middle of the day!

The confusion which had overcome her held on as she pulled into her property. She had forgotten her bladder again and decided to unload the car immediately – the frozen stuff had already been in the trunk for too long. And oddly, she didn’t once think about her predicament at the store nor her current need to pee. She was so occupied with her task – her mind still swirling with newfound, unaccounted for feelings – that she felt quite okay until she had finished unloading. She had just parked the car in the garage when her neighbor appeared at the fence and called her. Inwardly cursing, she turned towards her – one had to maintain good neighborhood relations after all.

Walking to the fence, she felt with anxiety how her bladder cramped and called for immediate release. So close to her toilet and still being denied relief was absolute torture to her. But she had always been proud about her strong bladder and she would never have admitted to anyone how badly she had to go to the bathroom. So she put on a smile and started a chat with her neighbor, unconsciously hopping from one leg to the other, bending over every once in a while and vividly showcasing her desperation in her facial expression. Whilst she was convinced to appear rather inconspicuous, it was clear for any casual onlooker to see that she was desperate to pee.

This went on for a long time, and the stronger her signs of desperation grew, the more she became aware of it. Only politeness kept her at the fence, hoping for her neighbor to let her go. How could she be so rude to ignore her desperation and just keep chatting? She couldn’t be blind to the obvious desperation, she thought, blushing at the humiliation she was going through. Courtesy would require her neighbor to end the chat and let her go! But it was not until her neighbor’s phone rang that she would – apparently reluctantly – say goodbye.

First Part

I was just walking home from school, when the following story developed in my mind. You need to know that it was quite a long way home and quite lonesome in its second half – time enough to make up an exciting story. For the avoidance of doubt: I was old enough to be legally entitled to this kind of fantasies…

Walking a street of small semi detached houses – almost deserted at this time of day – I had just pulled out some sweets from my pocket when suddenly I heard someone shouting: “Hey you!”

I turned my head.

“Yes, you!”

I saw a lady in her late thirties standing at the door of the house I had just passed. Her look told me that she was talking to me – so I turned round and asked: “Yes, Ma’am?”

“Come here for a second, please!”

The “Please” was barely audible. She sounded rather commanding – it was more like an order. At the same time she was walking towards the fence. She wore a slightly more than knee long summer dress with a large flowery print pattern as you wore them in those days. It was a light type of fabric adapted to the nice weather. Instinctively, I walked towards her.

She seemed intimidating to me, a head taller than me and definitely very well rounded. Her appearance made me feel weak and helpless in a certain way. She had large breasts which definitely caught my attention and her hips left room for fantasies. Her waist was well defined, giving her a very female appearance. Despite my awe, I felt attracted to this voluptuous body. My desire of her body and the obvious inaccessibility of it made her appear even more powerful and aloof to me.

“Did you lose anything?” she asked in an almost friendly voice.

I was startled. I had not expected such a kind voice – it made me feel closer to her than I had felt I could be. I looked around but couldn’t find anything.

Only now I realized it was the lady I had watched in the store. Already then she had seemed like a passing dream to me. Had she noticed me there? I had tried to behave inconspicuously and diverted my stare when she turned round towards me. What did she want from me? Why was she stopping me in the road and talking to me? Was she angry at me? Had she found my look obtrusive? Had I misbehaved by starring at her? I blushed at the thought that she might have noticed my interest in her body – my upbringing did not allow me to openly desire woman like that, it was considered to be rude. I felt bad conscience take control of me.

“Look here!” she said less friendly, pointing at the edge of her hedge, two meters in front of us.

I was disappointed. Her chilling voice and her posture destroyed all my hope. I had definitely lost her sympathy!

“You’d better pick that up and throw it in the bin!”

My look followed her pointing gesture: A used paper tissue and a sweet wrapper were lying there. I must have lost the wrapper when pulling out the sweets as I passed the house. I blushed even more. I felt caught. Normally, I didn’t throw away my garbage like that – and as it had happened accidentally, I had been seen and was being told off. Told off by a woman I had seen before, I had watched so closely and imagined so vividly during the last half hour that I felt I knew her. Now she was standing in front of me like a punishing nemesis. What an embarrassing situation!

Hesitantly, I walked towards the candy wrapper and bent down to pick it up. The lady came closer and bent over. She was so close to me, I could feel her breath on my neck: “Take this, too, and follow me!” she ordered, pointing at the tissue.

Fantasies started spinning in my head. I was not used to standing this close to a woman! A woman I desired! Barely able to concentrate, I did as I had been told. Was she aware that the tissue was not mine? Did she make me take it as an additional punishment? I felt so humbled! As she had indicated, I followed her to the front door. She stepped to the side and ushered me in, bending over a bit. I felt uncomfortable, standing in a stranger’s entrance hall, having been caught in a naughty act, awaiting retribution. My secret longing did not make things better. The psychological gap between my object of desire and me was growing as I had proven unworthy of her. On the other hand, I was excited to be close to this overwhelming lady, her dominant air impressed me and made her body even more desirable. And only the chastisement I was going through brought her body so close to me, so I was happy to accept the punishment.

I didn’t know the lady but from the discount store. I had neither seen her before, nor after. I didn’t know what had happened in the last half hour since I had seen her for the first time. I didn’t know she had been standing at her fence, chatting with her neighbor. I had no idea of the prior events: How, when she came home from the supermarket, she was desperate to have a pee, how she had been holding on all the way through the shop, hurrying from aisle to aisle at speed. She had almost lost control when she had learned that half the checkouts were closed due to hardware update and the queues seemed endless to her. Reaching the car, she had sighed in anticipation of getting home quick and running to the bathroom first of all.

The pressure on her bladder had eased a bit as she sat down and her mental confusing from the emotions she had gone through occupied her mind as she rolled towards home. Arriving home, instead of rushing to the toilet, she had decided to unpack the car first. To her dismal, her neighbor had seen her as she was done unloading and had parked the car – and called her for a chat. Her bladder had hurt; the pressure had been getting unsupportable. But she couldn’t refuse to answer and so they had spent at least the last quarter of an hour conversing about latest neighborhood gossip.

Nor did I know her secret discoveries during the shopping trip, the craving slowly taking hold of her unconscious mind, the desires she wasn’t even fully aware of herself. I did not know how her desperation had grown steadily as she was forced to chat with her neighbor; and how in the end she had kept hopping from one leg to the other – and how still her neighbor wouldn’t cease talking. How she had wondered if her neighbor would never notice her predicament and let her go. How to her relief, finally the neighbor’s phone rang and they said goodbye.

She had been running to her front door when she saw me drop my wrapper.

Completely desperate and almost wetting her panties, she had considered to ignore me and dash for the loo. But she remembered how she had discussed the problem of littering with her neighbor and cursed: she had to deal with me first – her neighbor would have seen everything from her window and reproach her if she didn’t act.

A convulsion let her bladder contract. She bent over and fought the spasm, successfully. Her sphincter was still holding tight, she silently rejoiced. But immediately the pain from her overstretched bladder took control of her brain again. She had not recognized me yet, too strong was her desperation. She needed to get over with this quick! In no mood to argue, she summoned me to her and had me pick up the refuse. She was not going to touch it! Too late she realized that now I was standing in her entrance hall waiting to be shown to the bins. The proximity of the toilet almost made her lose control. It was torment she went through. Again a delay – she cursed inaudibly and, bending over, briefly put one hand in her crotch to ease the pain. Together with exasperation, irate rage took hold of her. It all was this little brat’s fault!

She showed me into her kitchen and opened a cabinet under the sink, drawing out the waste bins. I did not hesitate and got rid of the rubbish in my hand.

“Not like that, little lad!” the lady scolded, stepping closer. “Can‘t you see there are several compartments for different kinds of refuse?”

She was standing behind me, and as she now bent over to show me the different recycling compartments, I was forced to bend down until my nose almost hit the bins if I wanted to avoid getting in her way, infuriating her even more. I could feel the fabric of her dress brush my neck as she pointed her finger at the bin destined for non-recyclables where I had disposed of my litter. My heart started to throb harder.

Towering over me, her breasts almost touched my back. Somewhere in the back of her head, memories of the scene at the discount market flashed through her mind, mixing her desperation with the pleasure of being desired. Some part of her deplored that I had bent down so far, not allowing her breasts to touch my back. But the excitement of exerting power and enforcing her will added a thrilling third dimension to her adversary emotions of desperation and wrath on one hand and a craving lust on the other hand. Yet underneath the piercing pain of her overstretched bladder, none of these emotions was able to work its way to her consciousness.

“Take the candy wrapper and put it in the plastic bin!” she ordered, indicating with her hand – as suddenly something fell into the bin. “Damn you, now my earring fell into the bin, too. You’d better get that out quickly!” she cursed. She had unwittingly been playing with it to distract herself from the immeasurable pain and desperate need to pee.

Her need had grown insurmountable by now. She felt her bladder twinge. A short spurt pressed through her urethra, pushing past her clenched sphincter muscles. She felt warm wetness between her labia. She had started to wet herself! Yes, she felt how the pee soaked into her panties.

She was angry at her neighbor, at herself and of course at me. Why did this have to take so long? She could have been at the toilet twenty minutes ago. Her anger at me rose. Why did this pupil litter in her front yard? Even now it would have been time for her to reach the toilet in time. Why was he too stupid to use the right bins? Was he actually mocking her? She felt a strange desire to punish me for everything she felt at the moment as her emotions unconsciously mixed. If only this lad could feel her pain, she thought! If only he would undergo the embarrassment and humiliation she experienced as she was starting to wet herself again! Yes, she felt another drop of urine escape her bladder, followed by another and again another.

I was so intimidated; I didn’t even consider objecting to her order. I felt her anger. A strange mixture of excitement and fear made my heart race. I wanted to please her, to calm her down. And still I wanted to feel her anger, hoping for her to get close to me again, to feel the warmth emanating from her voluptuous body. I was aware that only her anger brought her this close to me, that otherwise she would have been unattainable for me.

Taking off my backpack and kneeling in front of the bins drawer was done in the twinkling of an eye. I searched the bins to first place the candy wrapper in the right container and then look out for the lost earring. My vision was blurred by commotion. What did the earring look like? What was I actually looking for? My mind reeled, I couldn’t concentrate.

A brush of fabric let me look up – the lady’s dress had briefly swished past my head as she was positioning herself at the right corner of the bins. Thus, she could see what I was doing from an angle. She pulled up the front of her dress to avoid it touched the bins. From my vantage point, I realized, I could see her panties if I looked up at her. Enough light passed through the thin fabric of her dress to clearly show her white cotton panties. I was so eagerly starring at them; I didn’t realize the lady was looking right in my face. Instead, I tried to figure out if the darker spot between her legs was due to a shadow or if her pubic hair was shining through. Or was it a wet spot?

Her anger was growing as she saw how I starred at her crotch. Couldn’t that boy get his work done and go? Did he have to interrupt his work to stare at her? Was he enjoying her desperation? Had he detected the wet spot? Was he even gloating at her humiliation? She got furious.

Suddenly, she recognized me: It was the boy from the discount shop! A wave of unwarranted pleasure shot through her veins – yes, he definitely desired her. This was why he was starring at her crotch! At the same time she realized her vulnerability. He was starring at her panties as she was starting to wet herself, to humiliate herself – not only in front of a stranger, no, in front of a boy who had watched her before. It infuriated her even more. Was he dawdling to enjoy her weakness? Was he making fun of her? No, she wouldn’t let him get the better of her! She would show him who’s the master. He would not get away with this! Again, a spasm made her cringe. She felt her body give in to nature’s call. She would soon be peeing all over the place, and it was this little brat’s fault!

“Have you found the earring yet?” I heard her commanding voice, quiet but vibrating with ire.

I gave a jerk and started to rummage through the rubbish again. But I couldn’t get her panties off my mind. As I was mindlessly rummaging in the bins, a shadow told me the lady was bending down towards me again. I didn’t realize she was fighting off another violent spasm of her bladder aching to release its content immediately. Why didn’t she say anything, I wondered, and as I looked up, she was standing straight again. Suddenly, she took a side step forwards with her right leg such that the corner of the bins-drawer was straddled by her. What was she up to? Why didn’t she comment on my work anymore as she had done before?

I turned my head and to my delight I saw that she was gathering her dress higher. Enough so, that I got an unobstructed view at her panties from just half a meter’s distance. I completely forgot I had only wanted to check if she approved of my work. Instead, I starred at her crotch again. And yes, these panties had a wet spot; I could clearly see it now. Intrigued, I continued to stare. At the same instant, I realized the spot seemed to grow. What was going on? She couldn’t possibly be wetting herself? I was flabbergasted!

The next seconds were some of the most exciting in my life. The lady pulled up the dress almost to her hips and bent her knees until I felt her left knee poking firmly into my right ribs. The wet spot in her panties had become quite large by now and a few drops of pee were running down her inner thigh. A few seconds later, she had secured her dress in one hand and moved her other hand to pull her panties aside. I shall never forget how I looked in awe at her black pubic hair, splitting in the middle between her legs – my first ever glance at a woman’s inner labia.

Probably less than a second later, a strong gush of pee started to spray from her vulva, her stream slightly arching forward. I didn’t realize it hit the bins only a few centimeters from my face as she was forcefully emptying her bladder: I was so immersed in what I saw, starring at her crotch.

It must have been true desperation that made her do it. Had she just arrived at home and been on her direct way to the toilet when she saw me littering her front yard, I wondered? I had not understood her frequently bending over as a sign of desperation – she had disguised it as gestures to point out the litter and later the bins to me. But now it dawned on me that these might have been signs of desperation. As I had taken off my backpack to be able to search the bins for the wrapper and earring, she had taken a few steps away from me – had she intended to go to the toilet then? 

Apparently, she had decided it was not safe to have a strange teenager in her kitchen without supervision. At least, she had returned to watch me, fighting her desperation in vain. Had I felt humiliated until this moment, I sympathetically felt how humiliated she must be feeling now, peeing herself in front of me. I felt sorry for her and somehow I was ashamed of my arousal as I watched her. At the same time, the dominating distance shrank and I felt closer to her than ever before.

As soon as she felt she wasn’t going to make it, she had positioned herself over the bins and pulled up her dress. She didn’t care now what I would think. There was no time for worries. Just in time she managed to pull her panties aside before the full gush of her urine started. She was pissing all over the place. What a mess it would have been, had she not reacted so quickly! It would have soaked into her panties and then found its way through the fabrics’ meshes, she imagined. The pee would have run down her legs, pushed up her bottom, ran into her shoes, and splashed all over the floor, springing from her panties as from a sieve.

She felt alleviation as the pressure on her bladder eased. She did not mind now how she was spraying the garbage bins with her pee, how she was exposing herself in front of me; she just enjoyed the feeling of easing desperation and regaining control of her body. Oddly enough, she felt somehow dominant and in control as she saw her urine shooting out of her crotch in a neatly bundled stream of clear golden fluid, slightly changing direction as her hips moved a bit. Fascinated, she watched its origin.

She didn’t look where it ended, just how it sprang from her crotch and formed a nice arch, obediently following each of her movements. It was freely flowing from her urethra since by pulling her panties aside she had unintentionally parted her inner labia a bit. She was thrilled in a strange way. She had never done anything like this before and somehow the feelings of the day whirled through her mind as she felt the pain go away. Pleasure, excitement, shame, domination and control formed a potpourri of emotions, swirling together, mixing and fading away as quickly as they appeared.

Her stream was diminishing as her bladder pressure decreased and she started to think again. She looked down at the damage she had done and saw me kneeling in front of her, starring at her crotch, oblivious to the world around me. My arms which I had kept on the bins were sprinkled with her pee, and my t-shirt was not exactly dry anymore. Strangely, she wasn’t shocked or embarrassed as she would have expected. Instead she felt satisfaction that her ordeal was over and that she had made me feel the consequences of my laggard execution of her orders. Apparently, she thought, her mind had gone to lengths to make her humiliation feel as an act of controlled and justified punishment for me.

As the last drops were leaving her crotch and dripping onto the bins, I saw her pubic hair wet with stray pee drops. I did not want to take my eyes off until I had to. I had never seen a vulva before and I wanted to savor every moment. I winced as she suddenly started to move. I felt caught. I didn’t want her to know that I had spied on her when instead I should have been looking for her lost earring. I blushed. And I diverted my gaze to concentrate on my task again.

The rubbish was drenched with pee now and I had to dig through it to find the small earring that might have slid right to the bottom. Surprised, I realized I didn’t really care about the pee – it was so closely related to the memory of her pussy that I actually felt some kind of arousal as I was picking through the refuse, the bitter-sweet odor of her fresh pee filling the air around me. What would have happened if I had carried on searching whilst the lady was peeing all over the place? I felt a strange tingle in my nerves as I imagined how her pee would have gone all over my arms. It might even have hit my head, as I would have been bending over the bins, I wondered. Would she really have peed on me? Would she even have noticed? What would she have done if she had noticed? I would never know…

Remembering these seconds of pleasure, when I saw her vulva gushing jets of warm golden pee towards me, my mind was spinning in fantasies. This fluid had directly come out of this lady’s wonderful pussy, I remembered, wild fantasies evolving in my mind. It did not even take half a minute until I could no longer concentrate on my task. Instead, I looked up to see if I could steal another glance. I couldn’t resist the temptation. And I was lucky…

The lady had watched me as she was finishing her pee. She saw how I starred at her in disbelief and astonishment, how I blushed as I felt caught. Again, she felt strangely elated as she saw my blush – wasn’t it showing how I secretly desired her? But no, this must be a mirage of her duping fantasy. Her mind was aching to find a way to get out of the embarrassing situation. How could she avoid being the humiliated one? She could not risk losing her commanding position relative to me; she had to keep in control.

She had seen how I blushed and then started to dig into the bins – and she wondered what was going on in my mind. She saw the refuse was drenched in her pee and how I had to pick through it. This appeared strangely satisfying to her, it made her feel in charge and control. With her pee she had made his task even more humiliating to him, augmenting the punishment for his misbehavior, she thought. Or was that boy tricking her? Maybe he would even suddenly ran away, she wondered? She moved closer to avoid my immediate escape, still holding her dress up to keep it clean. Now, she had one leg behind my back, a little towards the left side, and the other leg was right next to me on the right.

Therefore, as I lifted my head to try my luck on another glance at her vulva, I almost banged it into her crotch: she was this close. I just had to turn my head to the right and I got a close-up view of her wet pubic hair. This was my lucky day! I made out her inner labia hidden behind a curtain of black curly hair, dripping wet with pee. Her fleshy labia shone in a beautiful tone of red, still slightly parted. At this moment, I didn’t care for anything but to keep looking. I would have loved to touch, but with my hands soiled in the bins below this was definitely impossible.

Meanwhile, she was coming to a conclusion how to proceed: “I am very angry at you!” she scolded. “If you had not thrown your litter in my front yard, this mess would not have happened. Instead, I would have gone to the toilet straight away as I intended before you interrupted me with your outrageous behavior. I hope you are aware that this is all your fault and responsibility!”

As I didn’t know what to reply, I remained silent.

“You’d better take of your wet t-shirt now and clean this mess!” she ordered, angry at herself for getting into this situation. She felt she had to dominate me to control the situation.

To get out of my t-shirt, I had to bend forward again, pulling it from behind and over my head. Holding it in my hands, I sat there, not knowing how to continue.

Meanwhile, she had gotten over her initial shock and began to find the situation rather arousing. There was this longing stare, the shy blushing, the desire radiating from my face as well as the submissiveness and begging for mercy of me kneeling in front of her. It turned her on to be the object of my devotion. She had never before in her life been in a position where she dominated other people and this situation was strangely elating to her.

She had been watching for a while. As she saw the t-shirt was quite clean and dry and how I sat there almost underneath her, looking up (into her crotch rather than her face), she had an idea: “What are you starring at, huh?” she blustered. “Take your shirt and wipe my legs dry first of all!”

I blushed at the notion that I had been caught gazing at her again. But then her second sentence was absolutely to my taste: I would have to look at her when I was drying her legs, wouldn’t I? I took the t-shirt, made sure my peed on hands were fully covered with it and used the dry parts of it to gently rub her legs from the knees upwards. When I got close to her crotch I hesitated. She hadn’t said anything about drying her pubic hair and I didn’t know how sensitive this area was. Would she want me to clean it, too? I got excited at the thought of it. Carefully, I moved closer and closer, touching her pubic hair ever so little as I was drying the upper inner side of her thighs.

“Pull down my panties so you can finish your work!” she commanded. “But make sure they don’t touch my legs – they are wet!”

So I dropped the t-shirt on my lap and carefully took hold of her panties, using one hand to take the wet crotch of the panties out of her hand to avoid it touching her thighs and pulling down the seam with the other hand. I didn’t care at all that I was touching her pee – I was so aroused by seeing her crotch and being actually allowed to look at it that nothing else mattered. She had stepped back a bit and closed her legs slightly so I could move her wet panties all the way down. After she had stepped out of them she said: “Now, take your shirt and dry my crotch. But be careful!”

My heart was throbbing in my mouth. I was so exhilarated. I chose another clean spot on the shirt and carefully dabbed the topmost part of her thighs, moving on to dry her wet pubic hair almost one by one, making sure not to touch her labia. I just didn’t dare to touch them, I didn’t know how she would react and I definitely wanted to make this moment last as long as possible. As I was doing this, I didn’t notice that I was leaning against the wet bins, soiling my pants. My concentration was focused totally at diligently drying her pubic hair. My body was pulsing in excitement.

“Use this to gently clean my labia now.” She said, handing me a fresh tissue.

This was even better, I thought! I put down the shirt and very cautiously dabbed her inner labia, making sure to soak every remaining drop of pee into the tissue. Believe me, it took a long time!

Unfortunately, everything ends and I had to realize that there simply was no more pee visible on her pussy. And I would not have dared to spread her labia and search the inside. So I finally stopped dabbing around and she reacted by saying: “Very good! Now find my earring and clean the bins.”

Her dress fell down to her knees again as she released her hold and stood next to me, watching. I dived back into the garbage and only after rummaging for quite a while I found the earring at the bottom of the paper recycling container. It was lying in a centimeter deep puddle of pee. I fished it out and handed it to her after dabbing it with my t-shirt.

Whilst she was washing her earring, I did not know how to clean the bins, so I took my already partly wet t-shirt and swiped the pee off their outsides and upper borders of each bin just to be doing something.

Together, we carried the refuse outdoors where I had to empty it into the main bins using my hands to separate the clean recyclables from the drenched remainder. Then, we hosed the bins down in the garden and again I had to dry them with my t-shirt.

As everything was done, only my clothes remained soiled. The lady (I still didn’t know her name and she probably did not intend to tell me) made me undress and put my clothes into the washer. It was an embarrassing situation, being naked in front of a lady for more than an hour, waiting for the washing/drying cycle to finish. And she didn’t do anything to ease my situation – instead she had me stand in the room whilst she sat on a chair, watching me. Somehow, I had the impression, she enjoyed it. Did she take it as compensation for her humiliation before? At least she didn’t do anything to ease my discomfort. Hopefully, she wouldn’t notice how excited I had been? I didn’t find out…

Walking home, I dreamt on about this wonderful experience and wondered if she had noticed that I actually had liked it.
