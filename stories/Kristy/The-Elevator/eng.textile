The Elevator
 Male Desperation
By Kristy (1997'07) m S#567

Sheena had just moved into a new apartment building. She was tall and slender, green eyes and auburn hair. Jason had been watching her since she had moved in and he wanted her incredibly bad. One night they met up with some of their mutual friends, and just by coincidence got to meet each other. Sheena thought that Jason was gorgeous. He had black short hair, pale grey eyes and a body to kill for. He quickly jumped at the opportunity to buy her a margarita. They both had had about 3 shots and vodka, 2 beer and 1 margarita, the only time that Sheena had gone to the bathroom was at the begining of the night, she did not feel that she had to go but she went anyway because she wanted to leave very shortly. Jason had gone a couple of times but still continued to drink beer. When Sheena said that she was leaving, he quickly took the chance to go with her in a cab. Although he already had to go pee, he didn't want to go and risk the chance of her leaving without him.

During the cab ride home they talked while Jason grew a little more uncomfortable.They got into the building and into the elevator. He lived on the 11th floor while she only lived on the 8th floor. A couple of seconds after they had pushed the button, Jason opened another beer and pounded it back. Suddenly they felt the elevator move and it pushed them into each other and then a sudden stop. He was very drunk and had to pee really bad at this point. Sheena pressed the alarm and the phone started to ring, when she picked up, they told her that they were unsure of why the elevator had stopped but assured her that they were in no danger and that they should be out of there in a half hour to an hour. When Sheena told Jason about this, he muttered under his breathe and then told Sheena that he had to pee really bad.

She told him that he would have to wait and they would be out of there in no time. He tried squeezing his thighs together, trying not to look obvious because he wanted to impress her. He knew that it would not help for long and that he would have to squeeze soon. He got a bit closer to her and tried to carry on a casual conversation about work, hoping that as he got closer he would get an erection and it would distract him. He thought that maybe he could hold on longer if they sat down, he was wearing blue jeans so there was no way that he could wet himself without her knowing and probably finding him repulsive. They sat down and she could tell that he had to go quite bad.

She moved closer to him and kissed him gently on the mouth. It didn't take long until he was fully erect. It removed an incredible amount of pressure and he was able to concentrate on her. She slowly rubbed his erection and he completly forgot that he was loaded. Suddenly the phone rang. He got up and answered it. It was the workers and they told him that they just about had them out. They said it would really help if he tried to pull the doors open but to be very careful. He handed Sheena the phone and went to the doors. He tried to pry them open but since he was longer erect, he found it almost impossible. Now he could not help himself, he had to pinch himself in front of her. She noticed and tried to massage his buldge.

Suddenly she hung up the phone and he could feel the doors slowly being pried open. When they finally got out into the hall, they thanked the workers but said that they had to get home right away. They got to the stairs and climbed 2 at a time. Jason was holding himself hard and knew that if he didn't make it in 30 seconds, he would wet himself. When they finally got to her floor, they ran to her door. As she tried to find her keys, he begged her to hurry. She got them and thru open the door. They ran inside and she brought him to her bathroom. He was undoing his pants on the way and could feel a leak starting. He just made it to the toilet and sighed a sigh of relief and he unloaded himself. When he was finally done, She kissed him hard on the lips. I am sure you can imagine what happened after that!
