Interesting TV commercial

We have an interesting TV commercial running here in Canada right now. It's for Ontario Toyota Dealers. In this commercial there's a boy about 10 years old and his dad is helping him put his snowpants and coat, mittens, hat and scarf on to go outside. The dad get's the kid all ready and he's just about to go outside when he says, “Dad, I gotta go”. So the dad helps him to take everything back off again. When he gets back down to his regular clothes the kid says, “I don't need to go any more”. That makes you look at his pants and that's when you notice the whole front of his pants is wet. It's quite a surprising commercial. They've got some courage showing something like that I think. I'm surprised there hasn't been any controversy over it. I don't think there's anything wrong with it at all myself, but unfortunately there are a lot of people out there who do often take exception to this type of thing. Too many. Anyway, I just thought I'd pass this along to you. Stay wet!
