I had several drinks of water before we left. I was told to go to the toilet before we left, but I didn't.
When we got to the park, I was asked to look after my younger sisters. I was wearing black knickers, a blue skirt down to my knees, and a white T-shirt.

After a while, I began to feel the need to pee. I ignored it, and I continued to watch my sisters. My family said they were going home for an hour, leaving me on my own with them, a responsibility thing they said.

After a short while, I really needed to pee. I crossed my legs, which helped, but it couldn't hold for long. I could feel the pressure on my bladder; it was sort of a dead weight. This didn't help too much, because it seemed to sink down. I knew where the toilets were; it was just that I couldn't leave them alone.

After a while, it became harder to hold, so I stood up to get a little pressure off my bladder. It helped, but again, the pressure hit me, and I was forced to sit again with my hands in between my crotch. I noticed a few people were looking at me, so I let go for a minute, fearing people might think that I had a problem. I had to make up an excuse to my sisters if I was going to go to the toilet.

After about 10 minutes, it was becoming unbearable. So I asked them to come with me to get an ice cream. Total lie, but was else could I do? They came, and walking 150 meters to the toilet wasn't what my bladder wanted. I was practically pissing myself when we got to the Pavilion. They wanted the ice creams, so we went to the shops first-we didn't pass the toilets. When we went to the shop and back, on the way, I dribbled a little bit. My sisters didn't see, but I knew I couldn't hold on for much longer. When we got to the toilets, they were locked for cleaning! I let go there and then as my bladder filled to the over-the-top limit. My sisters laughed at me, and they went and told my parents when they came back later on.

I'm now grounded for two months because of it; you would think at eighteen I am too old for this, but living under my parents' roof, and behaving like a child... All my friends have found out and I'm horrified by it. Thankfully my boyfriend was cool about it, though I can't see him for ages.
