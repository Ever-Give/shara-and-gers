I have to admit there have been times that I have enjoyed the feeling of desperation or wondered what it was like to have an accident at this age, but I wasn't prepared for what happened to me one day out in public.

Since I was starting college in a few weeks, my stepmom agreed to come with me for some nice back to school clothes. Usually when I know I am going to try on lots of clothes, I wear things that are easy to get on and off repeatedly. However, today I wanted to wear one of the new outfits I had just bought for school, which was a cute longer tunic and short skirt with ribbed tights underneath. Since we were going to be gone a good portion of the day, I had a big breakfast including two cups of juice and coffee, which seemed like a good idea at the time.

Throughout the morning we went from one store to another in a local plaza. Most stores and small boutiques don't have public restrooms and today, with such a big breakfast, it was worrying me. We were in a large discount department store when I really began to feel my bladder ache. I glanced around to see if there was a sign for a public bathroom, but couldn't see one from the department we were in. I was starting to get antsy as I knew I would have to pee soon. I usually don't have a lot of time between feeling the urge to go and absolutely having to go, but I didn't want to stop shopping either. And I didn't want to tell my step mom since she seemed really eager to help me find some nice things. I was loaded down with clothes by now.

Then my step mom said she wanted to look at some things for herself in a different department, would it be ok if she went? I told her that was fine, but began to worry to myself about how much longer I could hold it. I was already crossing my legs a little bit since the urge definitely wasn't going away. When she left me with my pile of clothes, I looked around again to see if there was a restroom sign. I walked over to another department, but all I could see was the changing rooms. I decided to walk over there with my clothes in hand, as I knew sometimes the bathrooms were nearby. I tried looking for an attendant to ask, but there wasn't one anywhere that I could see.

Now I was halfâ€“heartedly looking at clothes, crossing my legs, and pacing back and forth. I thought about going in the changing room and just taking my clothes off and peeing in there, but it didn't seem like something I could or should do. I wasn't sure what to do though, as I was getting really desperate and frustrated at this point. My bladder was hurting and I tried holding my crotch when I thought no one would be looking.

Then my step mom came back with an armful of clothes for her, and told me she was going to go try them on. I tried to act normal with her, but all of a sudden felt a short squirt of pee come out. I panicked for a second thinking I was going to just lose it right there. I somehow was able to control myself for a second; and told her I was going to grab a couple more things and then go try them on too. She must have noticed something was up, and asked if I was ok, but I told her I was just a little tired but otherwise fine. So she went away, and I quickly crossed my legs again. But as I moved another couple squirts came out, a couple seconds longer each time. I was worried already as I felt the crotch of my panties dampen, but peeing myself was not something I wanted to do. I just didn't know how much longer I could hold it.

I shifted my stack of clothes so I could surreptitiously grab my crotch, but as I did that I dropped a couple things on the floor. Carefully bending over to grab them, I felt a strong surge of pee shoot into my panties and go down my leg. It wasn't stopping, and I knew I was going to lose it right then and there. I squatted down next to a clothing rack and my full bladder just let go. I was peeing hard, through my panties and new tights, hissing onto the carpet. I hoped no one was watching me, pathetic as I was at this point. I couldn't move, as pee was shooting out of me with such force, I was afraid I was going to fall over.

Finally after a few minutes of total embarrassment and complete relief, I straightened up, picked up my clothes, and tried to assess the damage to my outfit. I felt soaked. I was glad I had been wearing a skirt, but the back of it was wet from where I had squatted down. I didn't think it was very noticeable, though, as the skirt was a dark blue. My tights were obviously wet, with streaks running down them from all the trickles I had let out, and the crotch was completely wet. I felt so much better having let it all out that I decided I would just find some new clothes to change into, and continue with the shopping day. I left a pile of clothes on the floor to cover the huge puddle on the carpet, and went to find another pair of tights. I vowed to myself that next time I went shopping I would be more careful about what I drank ahead of time.
