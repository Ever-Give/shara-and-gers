Locked

This is a follow-up of Millan's previous story that you can find here: Scaring Myself
 
I woke up kind of early and something felt weird. I had been dreaming about what I was going to spend the day doing, and I already had two ideas that I didn’t have time for yesterday. I yawned and stretched a bit; still terribly sleepy it took a while for me to notice what was feeling so odd…

As I turned over I felt the plastic cover against me and I noticed that I was peeing. That’s why I woke up! I was wetting the bed! It had never happened to me before, and I guess the constant bladder torturing the day before was the cause. Actually it was nothing more than a drop before I woke up but I would like to call it a bed wetting anyway. When I noticed I just relaxed and enjoyed the feeling. Felt great for my bladder that had been in a terrible pain the last hours of my sleep even though I didn’t notice that until now. I was lying on my right side, feeling my right thigh getting completely soaked as I slowly continued to wet my pyjama-pants and panties. 

It was getting all warm and wet around my private parts again which really turns me on, and I was starting to get aroused after only being awake for like 30 seconds. I threw my blanket on the floor, trying to make sure that it didn’t get wet so that I wouldn’t have to clean up that much, and I was quick enough to make it. When it was off I got a better view of what was going on, and it looked really cute at my crotch, a tiny wet spot on the front spreading really slow and never becoming particularly big, and a little cascade of pee running down on the front over my right thigh, straight out from my private area. The wetness continued to spread downwards a bit on both my legs, stopping on my upper (left) leg about halfway to the knee, but the rest of that leg was getting wet from the other, since I had them pressed together.

I turned my head to look at the backside where I could see my right ass-cheek being completely drenched all the way, a bit up on my left but not much, then a wet patch continuing also to about halfway to my knee, my pants completely soaked until it reached that spot, then it started to fade on the backside of the leg. On the inside though, both my legs were getting completely soaked, although mostly the right since it was "on the bottom". The pee continued even further down, the plastic cover sort of helped it run further down my legs, but I didn’t mind since it felt all warm and nice. I was lying in a puddle on my plastic cover, and it was probably the best way ever to start off a day, to wake up by an accident, getting all warm and wet and turned on. 

I sat up, and my left leg got just as wet as the right when I did, due to the plastic cover keeping all the liquid in one place. I got off the plastic sheet, and I sat on my knees a bit off the cover, trying to dry a bit so that I could move out without dripping pee all over the place. I had to sit with my legs clenched together, and when they touched each other, pressing a bit against my pussy, with all the warm wetness around, it felt so great I just couldn’t resist anymore. I started to touch myself through my pants, continued doing that for a while, then I let go and started caressing my thighs and ass until I was on the edge, I pulled my pants down a bit and went back to my pussy, where my hands professionally did their job until I had my pleasure!

I cleaned up, put everything in the washing machine and had a shower. I knew there was going to be more showers today, as this was probably the last day I would have time to do these things for quite a while, and I couldn’t miss the chance to try some more things. I finished in the bathroom, and went to get dressed. I went with a pair of normal cotton panties again, red ones, and I took another pair of pyjama like pants over them, just because I really like those and I didn’t know how long it was going to be until my next accident. Then it hit me, why should those pants be spared? They’re so nice and comfortable normally, they just had to be great for a wetting. Since they’re really soft and baggy, I figured they would soak up a lot and become really heavy when wet. They are grey, which makes things better, as they will definitely show off all the wetness from an accident.

I chose a pair of grey socks to go with the pants, and I put on my bra and a matching, big, soft and baggy shirt, everything just to feel nice and cosy. I then proceeded to lock both bathrooms from the outside, and I went out the front door.

Directly to the left of my front door is another door, which leads to some kind of a storage room. We have a safe in there together with loads of other crap, a safe that is really annoying to open. It is also possible to set a timer for the lock if you want to. I dropped off the bathroom key in there and set the timer for three hours. I was going to either have to hold it until then, or I would wet myself, as there would be no bathroom available until the timer had finished. By now I had already drank quite a bit, if I would’ve been completely empty three hours wouldn’t be anywhere near enough to be challenging. (On a side note, since it’s been a few years since this story, my holding capacity was not as impressive as it is today either).

The first hour was kind of boring; I cleaned the house and ate some, of course I drank a bit as well to make it challenging, it would be cheating if I didn’t. Its way too easy to hold on for three hours without drinking anything, and at this point I was trying to have some kind of a holding competition against myself. I felt it starting to build up, very little but it was a start, when it was two hours left. I went to study some, but it was really boring as always, and I gave up after like twenty minutes and had some juice instead. I emptied the washing machine and put everything in place, and had another glass of juice when I was done. 1½ hour left and I knew that with the liquid in my stomach my bladder would be full soon.

"Bad girl" I thought, "You’re drinking too much". 

And I probably was, I took a break in front of the TV and watched some crap that was on, usually nothing good during the day. I had to cross my legs for the first time after roughly 15 minutes when the first commercial started, and by now most of what I had been drinking had made it from my tummy to my bladder. The pressure felt great, my whole tummy was warm from the stuff I drank, but I was a bit scared that I would wet myself soon and have to wait forever to change clothes.

Ironically enough there was a desperate woman in the show I watched, she was stuck in a car with two others, and it was raining outside. The radio played "I’m singing in the rain" and her two friends sang a long to tease her. My bladder didn’t like that, and I had to hold myself with one hand for a while, pressing my legs together as tight as I could, but I couldn’t stop watching in case she would actually pee her pants. It took like two minutes until she could get out of the car, and then I didn’t see her again. Too bad, but what can you expect from TV!

I finished watching the show and then I stood up to get just a little more water. Standing up and stretching out my bladder after sitting down for a while when you need to go is bad though! It hurt and I had to bend over, and after a while I could slowly stretch out again and stand up. My natural reaction to get water was to go to the bathroom and get some from the tap in there. The door was locked since earlier which I had managed to forget, and my reaction to not being able to get into the bathroom with a full bladder was also pretty natural – things got ten times worse!

The pressure in my bladder overloaded for two seconds and I lost control for the duration, felt like 10 drops in my panties before I hit the door with one hand, and then jammed both hands between my legs, crossing them like never before, I managed to get back in control. Stupid door, I wasn’t even that desperate yet, even though it was starting to get bad. But the situation itself had made things different. One part of me loved the situation though, because my nipples started to harden the second I realised that the door was locked, and they were rock hard when I lost control. About one hour left and my panties were slightly damp, I doubted I could make this. I could never really get my mind of that door-incident; it felt so incredibly real even though I had obviously set the whole thing up!

I enjoy challenges though, I hardly ever get to do anything challenging in my life, and because of that I want things to be pretty hard to carry through when I play games for example. So I went and had those two mouths of water anyway, and I set another timer for one hour, one of those that keep on ticking, to annoy my bladder and tease it a bit. I needed something to do for a while, until the real desperation started and I would need to focus on that. I browsed youtube for a bit, some music videos and stuff, and I was crossing and uncrossing my legs all the time, shifting weight on the chair, never sitting still, to stay in control. I had to get help from my hands every now and then, and I tried to not look at the clock.

I got bored after a while, and I was way too aroused to concentrate on anything else. I started searching for videos of desperate girls, and actually managed to find two that had not been deleted yet. I accidentally looked at the stupid ticking clock, and saw that there was still 30 minutes to go. When I looked at the clock the girl in the clip lost her fight, and I heard the hissing sound of her peeing in her pants. Why was there still 30 minutes left on the stupid clock?! I was really getting desperate now, and everything was going against me.

I moaned a bit as I held one hand over my bladder, the other one I slipped in between my panties and pants, so that I could push really hard over my pee-hole, making it nearly impossible for anything to get out. It helped, but it started to hurt a bit now. My bladder was really, really full. I didn’t know what to do, I sat like that holding myself and was unable to move for like two minutes, while the girl in the film finished soaking herself and the camera showed her mess a bit. Both the girl and the accident were really sexy, and I got even more aroused after that.

I slowly lifted the hand from my bladder to start the other clip; it was showing a tall, sexy blond girl with pretty much a perfect body, wearing semi-transparent white panties and a white tiny shirt, sleeping in her bed. As I knew what the clip was about it made me think about what happened to me in my sleep earlier, and I giggled for myself as my mind wandered off, thinking about how my day started. I was in full control off my bladder all of a sudden, sometimes it’s just like I don’t have to pee at all when I’m desperate, but it only lasts for a short while. I continued to watch her, and the camera moved down a bit so that I had a perfect view of her ass, she was lying on the side, same position as I had when I woke up from wetting the bed earlier.

I tried my best to imagine that I was the girl in the clip. Since I’ve never seen someone wet the bed in real life, and just managed to do it myself for the first time ever, I wanted to know what it could’ve looked like from another perspective. This was as close as I would get to that. The girl on my screen tossed a bit back and forth in her sleep, and eventually got back to the same position as I woke up in. She seemed at peace and was no longer struggling, and suddenly there were four tiny rivers coming out of her panties at different places, running down her sexy thigh and ass.

The bed she was lying on rapidly got a bigger and bigger puddle around her mid, and the camera zoomed out so you could see all that was happening. I liked what I was seeing at the same time as I felt sorry for her, making such a mess in her bed. While she was peeing I remembered how desperate I was, and I jammed my hands between my legs again and watched her finish, she woke up and was shocked for a while before the clip ended.

I looked at the clock, five minutes left, but I couldn’t take it any longer. I got up and ran to the bathroom, with both hands between my legs, pulled the handle to the door – locked. It felt completely real as I had been so desperate that I again managed to forget why the doors wouldn’t open. I kicked the door, pretended there was someone inside, and I yelled for the imaginary person inside to hurry up, as I was about to wet myself really soon. (As I often plan my own desperation scenarios and try to make them as "real" as possible, I often play "mind tricks" on myself, like pretending there was a girl in the bathroom occupying it, so there’s a perfectly logical reason why I can’t get in there).

I ran on the spot with both hands between my legs, I bounced up and down, crossed my legs and held myself in all possible ways, constantly shifting between different positions to hold it in. When I had been through every position I knew I leaned against the door, moaned a bit and got my hand inside my pants again to push against my pee-hole, I was really on the edge now. The other hand banged the door, and I started talking to the imaginary person inside again; "You have to let me in, I really can’t wait!" No answer.

"Stop being such an ass, open up, I really don’t want to wet my pants!" No answer again.

"Oooh, I leaked a bit! My panties are wet now! Let me in, I’m peeing my pants!"

The clock rang! It surprised me and I jumped a bit. I was still in control, but I felt that my panties were wetter than before. I started walking with baby steps and two hands between my legs down the stairs, towards the front door. It is like 6-8 meters in total, but it felt like 100 miles! I yelled to the imaginary person occupying my toilet upstairs that I was about to get the key and open from the outside, and I was going to be really mad at her when I got in. Stupid girl didn’t answer of course; but I had no time to think about her now! I had to let one hand off my pussy to open the door, and when I only had one hand to hold myself with I needed to jog on the spot again, shifting weight and doing all those sexy "I can’t wait" moves.

I got out, and did the same thing when opening the next door. I was still dry when I got the toilet key from the safe, I managed to get back in and close both doors, then I had to stop and bend over. I was so freaking close now, I just couldn’t give in. I continued with baby steps up the stairs, but felt a tiny spurt escape me half way up. I thought to myself, "No, not now! It’s just two meters left" and I managed to stop it. I spread my legs to check out how bad it was, and all I could see was a really tiny little spot between my legs. I could live with that, the battle wasn’t lost yet.

I hurried up as fast as I could without peeing my pants, but then came the real challenge. The lock is a bit retarded from the outside; I needed to use both hands to get it open, and of course being just outside the bathroom made holding so much harder (Many of you should know that feeling/situation). I tried with one and failed miserably, but I would pee myself if I took the other hand away. I was starting to panic as I knew I couldn’t wait longer no matter what I did, and came up with the idea to try really quickly with both hands, get the door open in just a few seconds and then hold myself with both hands again.

Then I would pull my pants down and just let it out on the toilet. I started messing with the key, I couldn’t stand still when I took both my hands away from my pussy, I was breathing hard and I moaned like I was about to start to cry. I couldn’t get the stupid crap open anyway because I was just too desperate to do it, my entire lower body rocked back and forth and my hands were shaking. I felt another warm spurt in my pants, which I managed to stop when I dropped the key and jammed both hands back in between my legs. The key bounced in under the door, and I was completely screwed. 

The uppermost parts of my thighs were already wet and warm, and it felt wonderful. My bladder was basically screaming at me that it would explode any second and cause a terrible pain, and my holding-muscles in my pussy was completely exhausted. They gave in on me, and I felt a huge river forcing its way out, making a really loud hissing sound, cascading rapidly down my legs. "Are you happy now?!" I yelled to the girl occupying my toilet. "I’m wetting my pants! Will you at least let me in so I can have a shower?"

I closed my eyes and relaxed. By a reflex I pressed my legs together, even though it didn’t help even the slightest. My bladder pretty much sighed in relief, and only that alone was a really nice feeling, to get rid off the pain. Then of course the best feeling, that I was having an accident and couldn’t do anything to stop it, made things ten times better. The bladder feeling alone was great enough to paralyze me for a second, and I had troubles doing anything than just standing there peeing my pants.

When the pain faded away I could move again, and I was curios to see what was happening. Since the pressure had been so high, I had managed to wet almost my entire front. It had spread up above my pussy probably a good 5-10 centimetres, and the girls know it’s hard to get wet that high when standing up. I probably managed to do that since I pushed my legs together. At that height it was only slightly wet though, and from the top it looked almost like a half-circle of wetness down to my pussy, where it had spurted off outwards over both my thighs almost all the way around to the back.

Then it did the usual bend inwards, and the lower, outer parts of my thighs were still dry. My pants were almost completely soaked, and after my knees I had managed to wet my pants all the way around, nothing was dry. The backside was "worse", I always get wetter there. I was wet over almost my entire ass, not quite all the way up but close, then it just bended downwards again, went in a bit and spared the outer parts of my pants at my thighs, and a bit off the backside just above my knees, then it joined with what came on the front and soaked my pants from below my knees and down completely. I felt a few tiny spurts after I thought I was finished, I picked up the key and managed to finally open the door. Since these pants soak up so much I could actually feel that it was heavier to walk. I think I set a new wetness-record and it made me incredibly aroused. I went into the shower with my clothes on and simply left the puddle outside to be taken care of later.

As usual I took a long shower to clean up and wash off my pants. I enjoyed the shower and I felt good about myself for daring to do all these things over the weekend, it had really paid off. I found a new interest and had something to look forward to do again, even though I knew it would be a while until my next opportunity as I still live at home with my parents. I like how things seem to get better every time I do this though!
