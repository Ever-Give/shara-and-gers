So she pissed in her pants where she sat!

She lifts up her dress
And I think you can guess
That it's into her pants that she pees!

When pee runs down her thighs

And wants it to go on forever!

There was a lady from Wheeling
Who had a particular feeling
She laid on her back
And played with her crack
Then she pissed all over the ceiling.

The limerick packs laughs anatomical
Into space that is quite economical
But the good ones I've seen
So seldom are clean
And the clean ones are seldom comical

The limerick's callous and crude
Its morals distressingly lewd
It's not worth the reading
By persons of breeding
It's designed for the vulgar and rude.
